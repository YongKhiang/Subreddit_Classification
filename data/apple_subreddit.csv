apple,"I'm a huge AV nerd and I borrowed a pair of AirPods Pro from a friend to test out the Spatial Audio feature, and I see there's a lot of ambiguity regarding this feature and a lot of misinformation and these are my findings after thorough testing:

Firstly, the technology behind this is fascinating. It uses math and HRTFs to map audio frequencies as if they were around you, along with the extra mile Apple goes to have dynamic data by tracking your head movement through the sensors on the AirPods.

Secondly, content support:
Right now it’s super limited, only Apple TV content mixed in 7.1 and 5.1 or Dolby Atmos works.

What iOS looks for is atleast a 5.1 track output, in Dolby Digital or Digital+ to trigger the Spatial Audio feature hence, AAC won't work, and music won’t work by default. 

And the only apps which output 5.1 audio are AppleTV and Disney+
You can try Tidal if it’s available in your country since that supports Dolby Atmos music, I tried listening to some Shawn Mendes and Ariana Grande on my OnePlus device when I had a subscription but it sounded terrible, music doesn’t work that well with any virtual surround sound tech.

Secondly if you want to watch locally downloaded content, you need to play it back through the built-in QuickTime Player, Infuse doesn’t support Spatial audio yet, and those files need to be 5.1, AC3 in an mp4 container. I have custom converted and muxed some trailers and i'll try linking those below. Just download and Save to Files app and you'll be golden.

If you are willing to shell out money on Apple TV rentals, try out Gravity and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, excellent Atmos mixes with great overhead activity.

In Gravity, around the 42 minute mark, the alarm sound has a great overhead effect.
In M:I-5, around the 50 minute mark, the helicopter blades also provide an excellent spatial effect.

Also PSA: Do not download or try out “3D Audio” or Dolby Atmos sample videos on YouTube, they're mixed and exported as binaural audio, and will work on any pairs of headphones. The specialty of Spatial Audio is that it converts normal 5.1 and 7.1 tracks to Binaural Audio on the fly.

That’s it, Reddit is the only place where I can talk about niche things, hopefully somebody cares lol

apple,"I’ve been a devout iPhone owner from their very first iPhone model. I’ve tolerated hiccups with the updates and knew that Apple would get their iOS patches out quickly. 

The iOS 14 has been a monumental FU¢€ UP, the glitches just seems to be growing.  What I have notice so far...(this is in addition of the fact they didn’t let their app developers know about their sudden release of the iOS 14 wtf)

1) Constant freezing of the screen.
2) Some of Apple’s generated passwords being missing to the accounts that I used them for. 
3) Password list in Settings now requires you to scroll, the alphabet sidebar to jump you to the general is MISSING
4) Apple Security trying to get you to change passwords or ask you for passwords that are no longer saved even when using facial recognition. Basically cock blocking you...most of the tech folks are men so the gender term is fairly accurate. 
5) Photos is no longer intuitive and I bloody hell cannot find the rubbish bin for my deleted photos or most of my other folders. 
6) One of the most egregious one yet is if you rest a thumb or finger on a blank spot on your Home Screen it activates the Edit Page function and you might just be aware of it. 
7)App store may give you their “Logical” version of how your folders should look like and freezing your phone all at once. 
8) Glitchy response when you typing and want to go back a sentence or so to make an edit by using your finger. You can end up in the middle of that word or another word. 

I am sure there is more such as the music but I won’t know that till I open that can of worms. 
In short APPLE, this what I expect of an android phone. I had one for work and honestly for the current bloody nightmare that is the iOS 14 update, Android is looking a better choice.

apple,"With the announcement of the new Apple Watches and iPads last Tuesday (September 15th), I made an interesting discovery when I was looking to order an Apple Watch.

They have suddenly added an option for AppleCare+, this have not been available on any of their products previously in Norway, available on Apple Watch, AirPods, iPad, iPod, iPhone and Macs.

Previously we only had the option to add regular AppleCare, which is essentially only the extended warranty, without coverage for accidental damage. It also seem to have the same new terms as AppleCare+ in other markets have, where you have coverage for two accidents every 12 months, for two years.

More information about AppleCare+ in Norway can be found on Apple's sites [here](https://www.apple.com/no/support/products/).

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** I've also observed they have added AppleCare+ for [Denmark](https://www.apple.com/dk/support/products/) and [Finland](https://www.apple.com/fi/support/products/) as well, so it does look like they are expanding their offerings of AppleCare+ to more countries.

Previous to the September releases, they only offered AppleCare+ in Sweden, which has physical Apple Stores present.

**EDIT 2:** MacRumors picked up on this about one hour after I published this post today.

I'm pretty new to Apple ecosystem, I got MacBook and I'm really enjoying it. I'm coming from Windows/Linux and before I touched MacOS I thought that this OS is way more closed. And that's somewhat true (it's harder to modify existing OS components that on many Linux DE's) but on MacOS user is able to do almost everything, has full **sudo** access. And Apple stated that they want to stay with this idea of having more open OS in case of MacOS.

Meanwhile MacOS is pretty easy-to-understand OS and has very good UX. I love this combination of easiness and possibility to make more advanced things. And MacOS is very secure also.

My question is: **why Apple hasn't go the same way with iOS?** iOS devices are very powerful and unlocking them can provide infinity power for more advanced users. If this is done well, iOS can still be very user-friendly and secure.",Why iOS is more 'closed' OS than MacOS?,0.36,0,32,kubaork

apple,"I don’t know about your experience but recently, I got really turned off how the banner notification has been constantly abused by some apps by sending you ads, promos, nonsense spam, or what not that I just default to turning them off. And since the new widgets came out, it got me thinking about multitasking and how it could be implemented in iOS the way Apple would do it since I’m also getting tired of the clunkiness, or as Craig would put it, heaviness of the app switcher.

So why not have a slideover for the iOS just like in the iPad? Like a persistent drop down banner option for apps but one that you can dismiss and drop down back and forth. It doesn’t have to be interactive but at least it should be able to show some important info just like a widget. This way it wouldn’t be too taxing to the system resources and at the same time, it wouldn’t have the ‘heaviness’ usually involved in switching between apps by swiping left/right or downright going back to your homescreen, and god help you if you have multiple app folders across multiple pages. It doesn’t disrupt what you are doing except hide the top part of your active app so the incentive to not always use it is also there. Not as useful as split screen but could have high utility for simpler things like for waiting for your cab or food, or seeing a couple of lines from your group chat, or a quick glimpse at the weather or map, game scores, music, timer, etc. Very handy when you’d want to glean small, salient info very quickly or persistently. And yes since it’s not a notif, hopefully, can’t be hijacked by the app itself for their own promos.

I know Apple doesn’t like to overcomplicate how their devices work but I think this is a reasonable compromise.

apple,"Hello guys 👋 

After 9 months from the launch of **Book Track**, I am excited to announce the release of a great new version, which takes the app to the next level. **Book Track 2** introduces a lot of new feature and a new layout on iPadOS 14. 

The app is available on the App Store at this link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/book-track-library-manager/id1491660771](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/book-track-library-manager/id1491660771)

The app supports **iOS 14 Widgets** at day one. Two types of widgets are available: the first one shows title and subtitle of the chosen book, the authors and the book progress. The second one, instead, shows a random quote of the chosen book. 

Book Track takes advantage of the new sidebar introduced in the new OS versions. The sidebar shows the main sections of the app and makes available also quick filters for tags, series and reading status. Tag and Series sections are dynamically updated when a new item is added to the app. 

With the new version of Book Track is easy to keep track of the progress of your books. You can easily mark the pages that you have read and a clean graph shows your reading progress through the days.

apple,"On announcement day, I ordered a 44mm Space Black Titanium Series 6 watch shortly after the store went live. I'm still using the Series 1 Apple Watch and knowing how long it lasted me, I wanted to splurge a little on this one. I opted to use the 'Create Your Style' feature and customize the size, finish and band. I chose a black and white sport loop since it accented the Space Black Titanium well. I checked out and had an estimated delivery date of 9/25-9/28.   


Fast forward to today and I get a text from Apple saying there was an issue with my order. I contacted Apple's text support and was told the configuration I chose was 'accidentally' added to the store and therefore they have to cancel my order. In my case, the only thing that was no longer available was the black and white sport loop band. I asked if there was a possibility of simply selecting a different band but they said it would be impossible to do so as each configuration is its own product.  


Unfortunately, I'm now having to re-order my watch and looking at a delivery date somewhere near the end of November. Really disheartening.   


I was able to call customer support and get a little more help from a very nice agent, but it's still very likely I won't see my watch anywhere near the original delivery date. I just wanted to let others know that this may happen to them as well. If it does, call into customer support rather than utilize the text service.

apple,"*“One conscious breath, in and out, is a meditation”* - Eckhart Tolle

Most of us are busy or preoccupied enough that even one 8-second long investment toward relaxing and calming our mind/body is insanely effective. 

Please don’t just believe me. **Test me on this**. Breathe in deeply. Hold for a moment. Breathe out. This is mindfulness, this is meditation — not some fancy mountaintop experience wearing orange robes catching flies with chopsticks. Sure, that can be meditation, too, but how is that going to help *you*, sitting stressed in your home office or living room, *right now*? 

Do you feed your body water? Do you feed your body food? Do you grant your body sleep? These are all crucial to health. But what about breath? Many humans today are stressed enough that we’re in a constant Fight/Flight/Flee response, which means we’re unconsciously practicing shallow (defensive) breathing. This is great for being “ready”, but it’s terrible for being well or giving crucial rejuvenation time to our mind and body. Deep breathing signals to our body that we’re ok. It is scientifically proven to **immediately** reduce stress hormones, lower blood pressure, improve memory and concentration, increase happiness and feelings of wellness, and overall make us more productive. I can provide plenty of rigorous studies, but you can also feel the benefit for yourself right now. 

#WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS — LET ALONE MY MIND?

Most people get hung up on where to put their hands, which is usually a proxy complaint for being unsure what to do with their mind. The short answer is, it doesn’t matter. This usually doesn’t satisfy most meditation novices or newcomers. Instead, a longer answer is, choose one of the below approaches and see what works for *you* — since this is a very personal experience meant to serve *you*, not some guru, group, etc. None of these is “better” or “worse” than the other. They’re simply *possible ways* you can tap into your own internal process:

**A. Focus on breath/breathing** — Perhaps the most common method, simply focus on your breath. Focus on the sensation as it enters your mouth or nose. Focus on how it feels as it passes through your throat. Feel your lungs as they expand, contract, etc. Feel it as it passes by your nostrils or lips. Notice the sound of your breath. Just pay attention to *any* (or all) aspect(s) of your breath you choose, and *when* (not if) you notice your mind has wandered — simply, gently, and *most importantly of all*, **kindly** guide your attention back to your breath.

**B. Focus on *any* specific thing** — Pick a color. Pick a shape. Pick a person. Pick an object. Pick a part of your body. Pick a word. Pick a phrase (e.g. *“I am happy, I am healthy, I am well”*). Work to gently reaffirm this thought or object of focus in your mind throughout the entire in and out breath. *When* (not if) you notice your mind has wandered — simply, gently, and *most importantly of all*, **kindly** guide your attention back to your chosen focal point.

**C. Choose anti-focus — allow your mind freedom to wander anywhere** — Perhaps the most unexpected of the three, simply give your mind space to go wherever it wants, for any reason, for any amount of time. Simply notice, and practice lovingkindness toward your mind while you notice how much energy it has to run anywhere in the universe once it’s unchained and accompanied by a willing “you”. *When* (not if) you notice where your mind has wandered — smile lovingly and thank your mind for being so diverse and unbounded.

That’s it. How long do you meditate? Well, start with one breath in, one breath out. If it took around 10 seconds, that’s where a lot of the biological change happens most quickly. How did it feel? Want to go longer? Take another deliberate breath. More? Repeat as needed. 

#You don’t need a personal trainer for this. You don’t need a guru. You simply must breathe.

apple,"TL;DR: The MX Master 3 mouse feels cheap compared to the Magic Mouse 2

## History with Apple Products

I've been a Mac user since the pre-iPhone days, 2005 or so. (So, not since the Classic Mac OS days, but before Apple was what it is today). Since then, I've always purchased Apple notebooks, as I was in school for years, and afterwards, I liked (still do) taking my computer to work to dink around in between patients. My primary input device has always been the built-in laptop keyboard and trackpad. There's a lot which could be said regarding Apple quality, and how their trackpads have traditionally been the target of all Windows laptops, but that's a discussion for another day, and I really don't want to invite any more vitriol than necessary.

Fast-forward a few years, to when I started docking my laptop while at home. During this time, I was using Apple's wireless Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse (along with the Magic Trackpad). I love the gesture support on both the Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse.

## Coronavirus

This past spring, during the shelter-in-place order following the coronavirus pandemic, I found myself stuck at home, bored, with nothing to do besides housework, yard work, and mindless internet research. So, like any nerd, I got into mechanical keyboards. This has been a rabbit hole of an adventure. Six months after discovering the hobby, I spend a lot of time in various custom keyboard people/companies Discord servers, I browse r/mechmarket a lot, and I'm always looking for the next best thing. In case anyone cares, all my customs use vintage key switches and keycaps. (I have ai03's [Lunar [AEK]](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=96112.0), using [Alps SKCM oranges](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Orange) and M3501/M3012J AEK keycaps, and I have Clueboard's [AEK64](https://mailchi.mp/117b54497aaf/the-aek64-is-here-build-the-best-keyboard-apple-never-made), with [Alps SKCM blues](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Blue) and M0115 Arabic keycaps, and I have [Mekanisk's Klippe T (R3)](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=101772.0), with [Alps SKCL greens](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL_Green) and [SGI ""Granite"" keycaps](https://deskthority.net/wiki/SGI_Bigfoot_series). I also have some vintage boards that I plan on using in future 60% projects: a minty [Dell AT101](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Dell_AT101) and [NeXT Non-ADB (AAE)](https://deskthority.net/wiki/NeXT).)

Alas, I digress.

## Enter Logitech MX Master 3

Because I was having so much fun with mechanical keyboards, my eyes started to wander toward the Magic Mouse 2 just to the right of my keyboard. I remembered seeing MKBHD and other YouTubers review the MX Master 3 (and MX Master 2 before), and it always received glowing praise. I was worried I would miss the ability to swipe across the top of the Magic Mouse 2 (for various macOS gestures), but figured the Gesture button on the MX Master 3 would suffice.

### Gesture Support for MX Master 3

The Logi Options app really does allow a myriad of options regarding the Gesture button (and all the buttons!) on the MX Master 3. The gesture implementation is not as easy/seamless as the Magic Mouse 2, but it's doable. You press the gesture button on the thumb rest area, and while doing so, translate the body of the mouse in one of the four directions to invoke a gesture previously invoked by just swiping two fingers across the top of the mouse (for the Magic Mouse 2). Obviously not as easy as on the Magic Mouse 2, but I could probably get used to it over time.

## Finally, Why The MX Master 3 Sucks (For Me)

Simply put, this mouse feels cheap.

* Weight: Despite it being physically much larger than the Magic Mouse 2, the MX Master 3 doesn't weigh considerably more. It feels way lighter than it should for its size, at least in my opinion. (This is not unlike how Leica glass, despite their diminutive size, always feel like a super dense piece of kit, which partially contributes to the feeling that one is holding something proper and precious.)

* Plastic Feel: The ""soft-touch"" materials are just a little too plastic-y, and not quite ""rubbery"" enough to feel as premium as I assumed all mice should feel. Of course, the Magic Mouse 2 is basically just a big piece of Jony Ive plastic, but it certainly feels nicer than whatever they use to cover the MX Master 3

* Scroll Wheel Finish: Logitech opted for some kind of shiny coated plastic, meant to evoke polished stainless steel, I suppose. But it's clearly a hit-and-miss situation

* Scroll Wheel Vibration When Shaken: Because Logitech employs a feature called SmartShift, wherein the mouse can automatically switch between ratcheting and ""free-wheeling,"" the scroll wheel is not that stable when the mouse is physically shaken. There's a lot of side-to-side play of the scroll wheel, especially when in ""free-wheeling"" mode.

* Click Buttons: Coming from my current mechanical keyboard hobby, I feel quite qualified to say that the clicks on the MX Master 3 are more tinny and high pitched, and less thick (thocky‽) than the clicks on the Magic Mouse 2. There seems to be less definition in the clicks. When I click the Magic Mouse 2, there's a definite beginning and end to the click. It's a heavier actuation force, I think. On the MX Master 3, when depressing a click button, there's some play, even in the button-depressed state

## Thoughts

Ultimately, Logitech is not an Apple-specific peripheral company (duh). And, to be honest, it shows. A lot of Apple enthusiasts are dismissed for being brand sheeps, and there's certainly good reason for that. You can say what you will about those followers, but us true believers enjoy a level of hardware fit and finish, thought, and intention that is unmatched in the PC world. I think that's what's going on here. 

My expectation was that the MX Master 3 would be as nice-feeling as Apple's latest mouse. That's just not the case.

So if there are any devout Magic Mouse 2 users out there, who like me, were curious about YouTube's favorite mouse, I'd encourage you to save your time and just skip the MX Master 3.

And if there are any folks out there who have tried other ergonomic mice, and have found one whose build quality matches Apple's (is that even possible?), please let me know! 🖱️",Logitech MX Master 3 Feels Cheap (Compared to Apple Magic Mouse 2),0.26,0,17,ToniWonKanobi

apple,"Let me start by saying this is not intended to be a troll post but rather to foster a discussion about [the guidelines themselves](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/).

The following are the rules I have issues with, why, and how I would modify them:

&gt;**2.5.2** Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps. Educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes. Such apps must make the source code provided by the Application completely viewable and editable by the user.

The part about not being able to execute external code completely eliminates virtual machine applications for running operating systems within a hypervisor, it does not prevent an app from including a virtual machine, but it would effectively be useless because it would mean there could be no external connectivity within the virtual machine or a way to transfer files into the virtual machine.

&gt;**2.5.6** Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.

This completely prevents any alternative web browser from using any engine except WebKit, I would remove it... Although even if this guideline didn't exist, **2.5.2** would also prevent any web browser that could run javascript from being submitted.

&gt;**2.5.9** Apps that alter or disable the functions of standard switches, such as the Volume Up/Down and Ring/Silent switches, or other native user interface elements or behaviors will be rejected. For example, apps should not block links out to other apps or other features that users would expect to work a certain way.

This should be on a case-by-case basis, allowing certain apps like cameras the ability to use the volume buttons as a shutter release allows them to simulate how a physical camera works, and in fact the included camera app does this.

&gt;**4.2.7 Remote Desktop Clients:** If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user, and both the host device and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.  
&gt;  
&gt;(c) All account creation and management must be initiated from the host device.  
&gt;  
&gt;(d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.  
&gt;  
&gt;(e) Thin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.

This one is a big one...

* (a) Eliminate the part about only being able to connect over a local network, this prevents apps from providing the functionality to connect over the internet
* (a) Change the part about being able to only connect to user-owned devices because that prevents an app from connecting to a remote computer or server provided by work, school, or any remote server the user is renting/leasing
* Remove section (c), this prevents any service that provides access cloud-based computer access for a monthly fee.
* (d) This entire section prevents remote desktop apps from presenting any storefront to the user, you would not be able to access any storefront like Amazon, Steam, Microsoft Store, or any other form of store
* (e) This section conflicts with section **4.9.1** which states cloud game streaming services must provide a thin client for each game, either remove it or **4.9.1**.

I would like to point out that most remote access apps already violate sections (a) and (d)

&gt;**4.9.1** Each streaming game must be submitted to the App Store as an individual app so that it has an App Store product page, appears in charts and search, has user ratings and review, can be managed with ScreenTime and other parental control apps, appears on the user’s device, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.9.2** Streaming game services may offer a catalog app on the App Store to help users sign up for the service and find the games on the App Store, provided that the app adheres to all guidelines, including offering users the option to pay for a subscription with in-app purchase and use Sign in with Apple. All the games included in the catalog app must link to an individual App Store product page.

This conflicts with **4.2.7(e)** which states thin clients for cloud-based apps are not allowed and will  result in hundreds of thin clients being submitted to the App Store, as an alternative there should be an API for apps to create shortcuts on the home screen with unique icons, titles, and content rating information that go directly to that game in the catalog app permitted by **4.9.2**.

What would you change about the guidelines if you had the ability and why?","If you were able to change the App Store guidelines, what would you change, and why?",0.44,0,11,DanTheMan827

Your Two-factor Authentication is really an over-rated, meaningless and defective layer of security that has put me through several miserable wait times (24 Hours + 1 week + 8 Hours) on a roundabout path of madness.

**Meaningless** \- The question is why? Why are you punishing your customers through forced wait times? My iphone 8 dies and my icloud is disabled for having forgotten password and the only solution you have for me is to wait to for 1 week? – for what – background check? Why can’t you verify my identity like most other legit entities that are straightforward and effective– via email verification, security questions, or even physical proof of ID at a near by apple store? When DocuSign can verify my identity in just few minutes – why can’t you?

**Over-rated**– Your complex security forced me to buy an android just so I would have a “trusted device” associated with my phone number. Luckily I was able to cut through my wait time by re-trying and remembering my old password using android as my “trusted device”. But even with the password, I no longer was able to access icloud. I still needed “two- factor authentication” code.  Seriously??

**Defective** \- I received like 5 codes, sometimes two at the same time and none of them worked. Every one of them returned with “incorrect verification code”. After trying one too many times, it stopped working to provide a code for “security reasons” returning a message “Too many codes sent- try again later”. Unbelievable! I cried! 

Seriously I tried all possible ways your Apple support provided me  – including installing App support on a friend’s mobile device, providing my friend’s phone number as a trusted device, activating my old iPhone 5s, accessing icloud settings and security on my MacBook, updating my MacBook OS, using iforgot.apple.com, waiting for hours on hold and speaking with at least 5 apple advisors – who were nice and patient enough to walk me through the process of verification only to end up saying that I have to wait and try again.  

I’m writing this on the 4th day after the 5th advisor I spoke to, finally gave me the magic key and I got in. I got my icloud access. But was this really necessary?

Over the 8 years I’ve been a loyal iPhone user as my dad is a big fan. I’ve tolerated iTunes syncing, photos and video sharing and file transfer (that has no warning for duplicates and redundancies) across devices back and forth by pulling on my hairs and rubbing my forehead in frustration. This was the last straw!!! 

I’ve realized the new LG – K30 I bought from Target for $150 has everything that iPhone has and it comes with an SD card and it makes my life so much simpler to transfer photos and I can simple copy, cut and paste and I’m not forced to backup on a cloud which I am not comfortable with. Inexpensive – robust - simple – no warranty and no security necessary!

apple,"I don't know why everybody likes them so much, the only thing better about them is that they're on the homescreen and they're more colorful. They are worse in every other aspect.

Old widgets were resizable. You had your iPhone and watch connected? You used the small battery wdiget. You connected your airpods too? You clicked on the little arrow and the widget would grow.

They also showed better info, they could even play videos.

And they were more interactive, you could mark reminders as done, or stop, pause, and start timers, or write on them to save notes or get translations. All of that without opening the apps. The new widgets are just glorified app icons that only launch apps. It's hilarious to me so many people were complaining about the clock widget missing or being out of sync and it's just a giant version of the clock icon.

I also don't understand what's the big deal about having them on the homescreen. The older widget sheet was accessible from anywhere, so it's not like you had to do extra work to access the widgets. If anything, now it actually takes more work to launch apps since you have them spread through more pages or in the app library all the way to the end of the homescreen.

I am really trying to understand why people like them. I was excited about them when they first announced them but now I'd rather have the old ones back.

apple,,"All The Apple Park Transitions—September 15, 2020",0.96,233,47,Phooboos
apple,"Apologies for formatting here, I’m on mobile. Overall I really like iOS 14. 




**Widgets**

The widgets look nice and fit in with the overall iOS aesthetic (as expected), but sometimes I feel it would be better to just have the app icon instead. But I also don’t love widgets, so that could be a bit biased. I just wish they were more interactive. 

The Smart Stack is a good concept, but I want to see what developers do with widgets before making a final judgement on it. It’s nice that it figures out which ones you use at what times and brings them up automatically; but it’s not perfect. For example, the Maps widget will pull an address from either your next calendar event and have directions ready, or make a guess as to where you want to go based on previous activity if there’s none available.

I guess my main beef with widgets is that I wish they did things that were more specific. Like the Photos widget for example: I wish I could pick a specific album to display instead of just the suggested memories. They’re good overall, but they have some annoying quirks. 



**Home Screen** 

I like the changes to the Home Screen overall.

The ability to just hide specific home screens without having to move all the apps to the library is fantastic. It saves a lot of micromanaging having to select each individual app and remove it. 

However; the fact that you can’t rearrange them from that screen is kind of infuriating. In order do rearrange them, you’d have to go do the micromanaging thing I mentioned before and either remove all the apps from the Home Screen to get that particular one to disappear, or move them to another screen. 

Apple, if you’re reading this, allow me to move the frickin screens around!



**App Library** 

The App Library is nice, but it takes some getting used to. Most app drawers just put everything alphabetically which is great. The App Library in iOS automatically organizes all the apps into categorized folders instead. 

This is a great idea; but like I said, it takes some getting used to. It took me a bit to figure out which folder a couple specific apps went into; but other than that it was fine. 

If you don’t like the categories, you can just pull down or tap the search bar at the top to get an alphabetized list. 

Overall, the App Library takes some getting used to, but is implemented pretty well, IMO. I don’t use it much though, because I just use Spotlight Search to open apps not already on my Home Screen. 



**Activity/Fitness App** 

I like some of the changes here, but don’t like others. I do like that they changed the name of the app. It makes more sense; especially considering the announcement of Fitness+ today; which I’m sure was the reason for the name change in the first place. 

I like that they combined everything into the two sections, but I wish they had kept the calendar part separate. To view the calendar you now have to open your activity for the day, and then open the calendar. I preferred having an overview of the month and then looking at each day from there. That’s purely subjective though. 

Other than consolidating everything to the two tabs, not much has changed from what I can tell. 



**Messages/Phone**

I love that you can now pin conversations in Messages. It’s something I’ve wanted for awhile. It’s not quite how I would have done it, from a visual standpoint, but that’s not a bad thing. It works well and I’m glad it’s here. 

However, somehow autocorrect continues to get worse for me. I don’t know if this is just an issue for me, but autocorrect is straight up retarded. I’ll spell a word wrong by one letter, and not only does it not correct it; it tells me it’s wrong, but won’t suggest a replacement when I select it. Again; I don’t know if it’s just me, but it drives me crazy. 

As for incoming calls; FINALLY they made it so the calls don’t take up the whole screen. It’s just like a regular banner notification that you can flick away. It’s about time, Apple!



**Siri**

Oh, Siri. I wish you were better. 

I don’t use Siri for much. Mostly it’s just for reminders, timers, alarms, and the occasional text message. I wish I could use Siri for other things, but it can never seem to understand when I talk to it. 

Siri will pick up entirely different words, not recognize contact names, give me answers that have nothing to do with the question I asked, and more. 

As with the autocorrect thing; I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t use Siri hardly at all because it just doesn’t work right for me. 

The new UI for Siri is great, but it’s not useful enough for me. 



**TL;DR**

Widgets are good, they just need a couple things to be more useful. The App Library serves its purpose very well. There’s a lot of QoL improvements that I was waiting for that I enjoy immensely. Siri is... Siri.

First and foremost, I just don't see the use case. I primarily use my iPhone on the go. When I don't want to use that (in my bed or on a couch), I use my MacBook Pro. And when I need more than that, I either plug into a monitor and sit down at a disk or use my desktop PC. The iPad doesn't fit into any of these situations. 

I know iPapOS has some a long way, but i still just don't that much differentiation from iOS, nor is It a replacement for a Mac. It sort of sits in the middle of the two, a place where I never find myself needing a separate device. And physically, I find the iPad is a pain to use in bed or on my lap. Light as It may be, it's really uncomfortable to hold my arm up to interact with It in any situation. I also strongly maintain there's no replacement for a physical keyboard and track pad. 

Before you ask, I've tried iPads. Many times. I've purchased iPads and sold them, borrowed them, and tried to completely convert to one. No matter what I do, It just doesn't click. 

Plenty of people I know (and all the sales figures) indicate that users are over the moon about their iPads, and I truly feel like I'm part of an almost non-existent minority that thinks they're just blown up, uncomfortable iPhones.

apple,"I watched today’s keynote and It just made me really annoyed. I have a lot of other annoyances but let’s just focus on Apple’s naming strategy. SE, XR, Pro, Pro Max, Air, Pro XDR, Super Retina XDR, Liquid Retina, Retina... wtf is all of this? Before you jump on me, I understand what’s what and we are kinda in an echo chamber where majority here probably understand the differences but what about everyone else? And as the techie in my family and friend group this becomes pretty hard to explain and recommend things. 


iPad 

We should have an iPad se, and iPad, and an iPad Pro. Simple. Why is that so hard. 

Let’s look at the se:
The current iPad would be the se and would come in two form factors: the 9.7” and the 7.9”. They should BOTH start at 329 (maybe make the regular size a tiny bit more expensive and bring the smaller size down to 300). The fact that the current mini is $70 more than the regular iPad is flat out dumb. (I know baseline storage isn’t the same currently)

The iPad:
The current air would move to this new moniker. I personally think it’d be smart to offer this in a mini form factor with all screen. Or up it like an inch. 
Side note: What bothers me right now is that if I was an average consumer there’s no reason for me to go spend the extra money on an 11” pro when all the current air lacks  is pro-motion, Face ID, and quad speakers. And tests aren’t out, those stereo speakers might actually get decently loud. Of course I won’t discredit Lidar but that seems like more of a future selling point to me. 

The Pro:
Leave it. It’s fine and it works. 


So we have 2 sizes for each, the naming makes sense (to me) and falls in line with everything the iPhone SE is about.
Let’s look at the watches now. This one is tough because the naming system makes sense on its own. But when you look at what the se is all about the series 3 falls more in line with this than the newly released se does. But you also don’t want to call a watch “pro”. That seems tacky honestly and doesn’t feel like a good move marketing wise. Also the fact that the series 3 has totally different cases sizes could come off as confusing.

To me I might lose some people here (not that I had many to begin with haha) but I would just axe the series 3 and have the se and the Apple watch. Also I’d ditch the series number (just like they did with iPads). 


Let’s move to iPhones. Who is buying the XR!? Why does Apple still carry this? I understand the idea is to hit each price point with a phone but I think if you’re spending $600 on a phone you have an extra $100. And if you’re on a budget there’s the se. So let’s have an iPhone Pro, an iPhone, and an iPhone se. 

iPhone Pro
We can ditch the numbers all together. And let’s ditch the max please. The current iPad pros don’t get called pro and pro max. A pro is a pro. 

iPhone 
Let’s have two sizes like the pro! Maybe kick the smaller one down to the price of the current xr and raise the bigger one a bit closer or to the existing 11. 

iPhone se
Add a bigger screen option. That’s it. Please, we don’t need to add on a name to know it’s a bigger phone. We can see that. It’s not hard for a sales rep to ask, “do you want the big one or the small one?” (That applies to this whole naming rant.)

Let’s talk about Macs now. This isn’t too bad as it sits currently. Mainly, let’s just get rid of the “air” and call it MacBook. So we can have the MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac mini. This is pretty fine, we can differ from the naming system because these computers are totally different from mobile devices. 

Displays... jeez... what the absolute heck do all these words and letters mean haha. (I mean I do know what they mean but it’s ridiculous) Super Retina XDR, excuse me wtf? Maybe let’s just have Retina, Retina Plus, XDR, and XDR Plus. 

Retina
Pretty much every baseline product Apple offers can use this name for the display. All the se’s, and the MacBook. 

Retina plus
Pretty much takes the place of Liquid Retina for mobile devices and on computers occupy MacBook pros

XDR
You can call the display on the iPhone Pros XDR and actually I’d like to call iPad Pro displays XDR as well and that would make more sense once Apple adds pro-motion to iPhones. The 2 iMacs would fall under this. I guess the current series 6 watch fits under this too, at least in my head.(I’m being lazy now, you could make an argument that iPhones and iPads don’t display 4K content and don’t deserve the XDR name and I’d agree with you) 

XDR Plus
This would be, for right now, just for the current display. 

It’s funny I don’t agree with these display names but I think it’s very Apple to not dive into the specs and just say; this is good, this is great, this is better, and this is the best. 


I kinda miss simpler times when we just had iPhone and iPad and iPod: shuffle, nano, classic, touch and MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro.

apple,"TL;DR Apple wants bye bye to 5w and usb a charge brick


There are many controversies and rumours and thoughts on why Apple is removing the charge bricks from iPhone(and now Apple Watch). That it is for slimmer box, e-recycling, more revenue bla bla bla. But since watching the event and the website update, I sort of got what Apple is aiming for in another view, which leads up to the above reasons anyway. 

In my personal thought, Apple is trying to push through full usb-c support at least on the wall plug side and at the same time drop 5w manufacturing altogether. 

To support that, 

1. the new iPads are getting a usb-c power brick(even iPad 8th gen!) 

2. apple watch has a usb-c end magnetic charger listed on the accessories page. Although there is nowhere mentioned if usb-a or c cable is coming in the box. 

3. iPhone pro 11 got usb c to lightning. 

4. apple watch and iPhones(non pros) are the only two devices that comes with a 5w/usb a charger (Don’t know why charge brick is gone on pros as well tho. Maybe those are not going?)

So Apple wants to phase out usb a and 5w at the same time not willing to provide faster chargers. 

In the near future, there would be no 5w charger/ no usb a power brick and that would trim down some of the little messy charger/cable supply for Apple.

apple,"Hey r/apple, 

We are 2 days away from Apple's event and as always, this subreddit's rule/operation will change to accommodate the influx of new users and to ensure that everything goes smooth. 

One of these changes is restricting the ability to submit posts to moderators only. This helps us control spam to a minimum, as well as control rule breaking posts (i.e. reposts). 

Some users thought that they would like to shift discussions from the main event thread to a separate thread as announcements are made, and we agreed. Starting a few events ago, we  (mods) started to submit articles with breaking news from the event so that those threads can become the centralized discussion for say, the new iPhone or the new iOS.

Last event (WWDC '20), a few Redditors thought that we were getting paid MacRumors and/or 9to5Mac because we submitted posts coming from those sources during the event. I want to take this space to clarify that no one in the mod team is being paid by any blog/press so that they can get their articles submitted by us. We will submit whichever article we find first. If 9to5 posted the article first, they will go on the board. Same thing with The Verge, MacRumors, you name it. 

We're essentially [copying the same actions other subreddit takes before huge events](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/gz4i1p/updated_time_this_thursday_see_the_future_of/) to minimize spam, rule breaking content. 

I hope this post clarifies where we come from, and see you on Tuesday!

apple,"So as you all know Apple has a YouTube channel and they don't run ads on it. But a lot of people watch the event on YouTube and that got me wondering how much does streaming the Apple event cost YouTube.

Before we go any further I'd like to make a few assumptions. Im going to be assuming that everyone will be watching at 720P. Some people dont have the bandwidth for 1080P so 720p is realistic. 

Now we must figure out how much data one hour of YouTube at 720p uses. [This](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-much-data-does-youtube-use-964560/) report from android authority puts that value at 1.2 -2.7 GB . Well assume 2 Gigs per hour. Now Apples last event WWDC, has 10M views on YouTube. But not every ones going to sit through the entire thing. So lets say the average person will watch an hour of the almost two hour event (Audience retention on YouTube is about 50% anyway). So over a few days or weeks Youtube will have to serve about 20 million gigabytes of Apple event data to people. 

Now we have to figure out how much that will cost YouTube. [Here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-pricing) you can find out how much google charges google cloud users to move around a gigabyte of data. They charge about 8 cents per gigabyte. But google isn't paying those rates. There are a lot of figures for the margins on cloud computing [this](https://tbri.com/special-reports/cloud-vendor-profitability/) article puts it at 60% and [this](https://www.investopedia.com/slug-placeholder-4587679) article puts it at 35%. So lets assume that Google operates at a 50% Margin. So that means that it'll cost them 4 cents to deliver one GB of data.

That brings their total to **$800,000**. Now there are some costs that I haven't looked at here, it takes a bit of processing to encode that video and send it to the end user and that costs money. But I am not going to add that here as we've made a lot of assumptions above. So it could cost google anywhere from $800k to well over $1M.

apple,"Hey Apple subreddit,

I'm the developer of Apollo for Reddit, a Reddit app for iOS that the Apple community has been really kind to in the past. I wanted to keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing (not a lot of people seem to know but Apollo is my full-time job!) so I thought I'd make a post showing all the goodies in Apollo version 1.9.

Download link: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575

In a nutshell, Apollo is a Reddit app built from the ground up to be a first-class app for iOS. I didn't want just another cross-platform hybrid app that feels wonky, but an app built specifically to feel right at home on iOS and take advantage of all of its features. All while being super fast, clean, and very customizable, with a ton of awesome power features like a super-charged media viewer with GIF scrubbing, swipe gestures, slick comments view, smart rotation lock, and so much more. And free to use as long as you want (with the option to support for a few bucks).

My mom also says it's great: https://i.imgur.com/CStrRVr.jpg Plus over 100K 5-star reviews from not my mom!

Oh, and there's a TestFlight signup at the bottom if you want to beta test the app, as well as details on the iOS 14 update to drop when iOS 14 does!

Anyway, without further ado here's the changelog:

## Changelog

Apollo 1.9's a massive update to Apollo that's taken months and months to complete, but I'm really happy with the result, and it brings together a ton of ideas from the community to make Apollo even nicer to use. The update includes a variety of features around crossposts, flair, new app icons, translation, and quality of life improvements. Thanks to everyone who writes in via email or via the [ApolloApp subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/apolloapp), your suggestions for what you want to see in Apollo help immensely and really motivate me to keep making Apollo better and better.

Without further ado, here are the changes included in this 1.9 update to Apollo:

### Crosspost Viewing

Crossposting (taking an existing post and reposting it to a similar subreddit) has been a big part of Reddit for ages, but recently it became a full-fledged feature where you can see exactly which subreddit it came from, and quickly jump to the original post. Apollo now supports this fully, so you can see the interesting content of the post, but also quickly jump over to read the original discussion! Often it's like getting two interesting discussions in one!

### Crossposting

Similar to being able to view crossposts, you can also easily perform a crosspost if you want as well! Simply select the post you want to crosspost, write a title, select the subreddit to crosspost it to, and bam, you're off to the races.

### Image Flair

Flair is a little “tag” users can add to their usernames in subreddit, and some subreddits even allow small images/icons to be added in addition to text, like the icon for your favorite sports team, or a character from your favorite TV show. Apollo now shows these beautifully!

### Setting Your Flair

In addition to being able to view the flair as discussed in the previous item, you can now set your own flair! Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs so you can add a little personality to your comments, showing which language you’re learning, your username in a video game the subreddit is about, your fitness goals, etc.

### View Long Flair

Some users set loooong flair, and as a result it can get off, which can be annoying when you’re trying to figure out what it says. Well be annoyed no longer, for you can simply tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!

### Find Posts with Same Flair

If the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs (say, being able to tag whether your question is about a certain character, or a certain topic), you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.
    
### 5 (Yeah, Five!) New App Icons!

This update has taken a ton of time to work on, and as a result I was slightly behind in including the Ultra icons I wanted to include, but as a result there's now a proper Icon Bonanza, with five new icons being included in this update. The first three are Ultra icons, all made by the same incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles, who I’ve been a fan of for a long time. I love how these turned out, we have our beloved Apollo mascot reimagined as an angel, a devil, as well as a zany pilot, all in gorgeous, colorful iconography. But those three icons aren't all! Next up, we have a beautiful new Apollo icon representing the trans pride flag (originally created by Monica Helms), which came out really awesome and is a great addition. And last but not least, our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, makes his second appearance with the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon! I love this set of icons so much, it’s going to be really hard to choose.

### Easy Language Translation

Reddit is home to a diverse set of communities that have a variety of fascinating conversations, but sometimes it’s tricky to understand what’s being said if the conversation is in a language you’re not familiar with. Heck, you might even have no idea what the language is! Now Apollo will be able to detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! It is so handy, whether you’re following a fascinating conversation or even trying to learn a new language.

### Fast Subreddit Selector

Whether you’re trying to add a single subreddit to a filter, or adding multiple subreddits at a time to a multireddit, Apollo is now even faster at doing these tasks, with an auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.

### Total Collapsed Comments &amp; Remembering Collapsed Comments

Two handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation, which can be super handy for viewing a comment thread. The second thing, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!

### New Settings, Filters Tweaks, Bug Fixes, and More!

A bunch of awesome new settings have been added to Apollo, like being able to disable the auto-looping of videos with audio, or being able to make it so translation options always show up. Filtering is also even more powerful, with your filters being able to target flair and links as well (in addition to the title), and fixes a few filtering bugs. Apollo also now shows videos from Reddit’s experimental 'RPAN' service, which is essentially a kind of live stream post that you can now view within Apollo. Of course there's a bunch of other small bug fixes around Apollo, from the occasional account accidentally signing out, to video bugs, to Apollo quitting in the background when it shouldn’t, as well as a bunch of other small tweaks across the app to improve your quality of life while browsing!

### Known Issues

(To be fixed very shortly. Please let me know if you're on the iOS beta or a stable version because a lot of the issues are understandably only present on the iOS beta, but a fix for those will be out soon as well when iOS 14 drops)

- In weird cicrcumstances you can get duplicated audio
- When rotating device it can sometimes throw you up the feed
- Some accounts with a lot of data can have a bit of lag when returning from background (if this happens to you please send me your logs, Settings tab &gt; About &gt; Logs)

## TestFlight and iOS 14 Beta

I've been working hard at an iOS 14 update with widgets, picture in picture video, a new photo picker, and much more, so if you're interested in beta testing that and providing your feedback/bugs, that would be awesome! You can sign up here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/I6svnXDz

Also note that for this 1.9 update I'm testing a ""phased release"" feature in App Store Connect so it may take a few days to get out to everyone, but the TestFlight beta has it immediately if you're willing to endure some testing and providing feedback as well. :)

If you have any ideas about future updates, suggestions, or just general questions I'm happy to answer as well. It sounds bullshitty but I genuinely do build Apollo with the community in mind and giving people the Reddit app of their dreams.

apple,"This is a Public Service Announcement for everyone to make sure to obtain an original Apple Store receipt when buying a secondhand Mac. The removal of activation lock will only be resolved by submitting original Apple Store receipt.


 I bought my 16” 2019 Macbook Pro here through r/appleswap and the previous owner bought it sealed refurbished through Swappa. So the original owner(person from swappa or whoever sold it to him did not have the apple reciept which was required by the activation lock team to remove the lock.

I went through multiple senior apple advisors. Went to the apple store and had a genius tech help me. Wrote to the Apple Developer Team support. Spoke to Customer Relations and nobody was able to remove the activation lock. I sent whatever information I had and the previous owner had from appleswap (swappa reciept showing serial#, paypal reciept, screenshot of the macbook being under my iCloud account. None of this was enough to remove the activation lock. The only way it was going to be resolved was with an official apple reciept. Email or paper copy. 

I understand now that I should have probably not bought on appleswap without the original reciept. However before the T2 chips were introduced to the macbooks(2018 and later) All that was needed to make sure that the Macbook was safe to use was to make sure no iCloud account was attached. This was my first time purchasing a secondhand Macbook that was made after 2018. I had bought two Macbook Pros before this (2014 15” and 2007 15”). 

My whole gripe with this problem is that there was no previous person who we could contact to get the details to remove the activation lock since Apple never removed the lock when they refurbished it because the previous owner before me bought it sealed refurbished from swappa so he was technically the first user to attach his iCloud on the Macbook Pro after the refurbishment process.

The second issue is that the activation lock got triggered after I was attempting to install the Big Sur beta software in the beginning of July. I understand beta software comes with bugs but as a user who uses Xcode to build applications I had a reason to install it. I had also used the Macbook for a whole month before this issue arose. 

Third issue is that this was a KNOWN issue in the apple developer forums. Plenty of people who were original macbook owners could not access their macbooks with their own iCloud accounts. Apple decided that they would just ask everyone for their apple reciept leaving secondhand owners to be left with dead weight.

Fourth issue is that the first apple advisor i spoke with assured me that the way to fix the issue was to remove the macbook from my iCloud account. I believe that if it was still attached I might have had better luck proving the Macbook was mine. Apple team completely disregarded this fact that I kept bringing up. 

I understand the security behind the T2 chip and the activation lock. But if I was able to show them proof that I had it attached to my icloud and proof of receipt from a previous seller with the serial number why would this not be sufficient to removed the activation lock that they themselves forgot to remove during the refurbishment process?

I’m currently still trying to figure out what to do with the macbook that I paid almoat $2500 for. I could do a chargeback or open a case in paypal to get it resolved but then that leaves the previous owner with the same dead weight. 

By far the worst experience i’ve had with apple throughout all my years of being a customer. I guess some things you learn things the hard way. Always ask for the receipt.

EDIT:
Had to make an edit to add a few more details.

This is a screenshot from my phone. Same one I sent to apple proving that the mac was tied to my account and I enabled Find My Mac from the Macbook. How was I able to do this if the activation Lock said it was not tied to mines? Also apple asked me to remove the mac from my account in order to remove the activation lock. Thus now leaving me with no connection the macbook i have in my possession that nobody has marked Lost or stolen.

This is just a Macrumors Forum thread detailing several people with the issue. Most affected were 2019 16” MacBooks that had installed Big Sur Beta. Same macbook I have in my possession. Thanks

apple,"Hi r/apple – I originally built [Minimal | Notes](https://minimal.app) because my dream writing app just did not exist. So every feature that lands in Minimal originates from a real need, something particular (maybe a little odd), and something that isn’t adequately being served by existing notes apps.

So here’s the story behind Publish as Website, Minimal’s latest feature.

**I wanted an easy way to share essays and little articles that I write.** Yes, I could copy/paste and publish it to Medium or send a few emails, but I really just wanted to take my note, convert it to a website exactly as it is, and share it with the people that I want to connect with. Think of it as bringing a blogging tool inside of a notes app, without adding any complexity or ugliness.

So now that it’s live, **Minimal reduced the number of taps required to publish from tens or hundreds to like, 2 taps.** (Okay, technically 3 taps.) Boom, boom, it’s published, here’s the website. And the websites are beautiful – here’s an example: [mnml.ly/12bqqpen](https://mnml.ly/12bqqpen)

# How it works
To publish, open a note &gt; tap the action button in the top-right corner &gt; select “Publish as Website.” The website will go live in microseconds.

As you edit your note, the website automatically updates.

To remove the website, just delete the note or tap “Unpublish.”

# Inspiration
I love [carrd.co](https://carrd.co) – I use it to create just about every website: it’s easy, fun, and beautiful. And it occurred to me that this kind of workflow should exist for articles, essays, thoughts, poems, etcetera. Minimize taps, maximize beauty. Make expression easy.

I also love beautiful typography. Avenir Next is a wonderful typeface (really, all of these hyper round sans serifs are like 😍🥰), off-white and dark-dark-gray are such soothing colors, and **ample empty space is probably the best thing ever.** And to have these websites be so extremely readable (think: max line width of some 65 characters or so) is just cool. 

The one other piece of inspiration – strange as it might sound – is software documentation. I love the big headers, short paragraphs separated by double returns, hyper-pragmatic design.

# How I built it
I’m good at iOS development, and bad at everything else. To get Publish as Website working, **these are the technologies I learned** or improved at -&gt;

- JavaScript
- Node JS
- HTML, CSS
- AWS
- DNS stuff

I spent about 2 weeks chewing over the Publish as Website project – reading articles, chatting with friends, drawing ideas, and going for walks and drinking Negronis. **Taking a birds’ eye view over the whole concept.**

**Then I broke it up into micro tasks that I was confident could be completed in 1-2 days each.** I’ve noticed that a subsystem in software can be perfect if it can be built in a single day. Basically, that’s the amount of time where the brain can hold on to absolutely every detail. After a day of intensity details get lost, so compartmentalizing is super useful, allowing for elegant micro-systems to coalesce into a hopefully-elegant super-system.

Then I started with the hardest parts, and got to work, session after session, until the whole thing was built.

Minimal is live in a few countries – go to [minimal.app](https://minimal.app) and see if the smart banner shows up at the top. 

In other countries, Minimal is in private beta and you can download for free using Apple's TestFlight. Once launching publicly, I plan to charge a small monthly or annual fee after a super long free trial. However *beta testers will continue to have unlimited access to everything, totally free*. You can lock in your free access and begin contributing to Minimal’s roadmap by visiting [minimal.app](https://minimal.app) and joining the beta.

It’s absolutely flawless. It’s so fast, it’s smart, it’s got a gorgeous body with a great screen, and the battery is to die for. I could write a 7-paragraph review of it, but that’s not why I’m here. 

In addition to recently getting my new phone, I also just had surgery. Prior to my upgrade, I used my iPad a lot for my entertainment and browsing and reading, since it was so much bigger than the SE and it had a battery that lasted more than 5 hours. But now, with the Pro Max and my new inability to walk, I found the perfect balance. The Pro Max is big enough to enjoy my Netflix and reading, and I only have to plug it in at night.

Just opened it up and noticed a [big ol' scratch on the chassis](https://imgur.com/a/pJhTiH0). Very disappointing. I'm 100% sure it wasn't me - haven't had so much as a mark on my Macbook for years - but it's impossible to prove. Not to mention that repairing it would require replacing the whole case yet again, which seems kind of ridiculous for aesthetic, albeit annoying, damage.

Has anybody had the same experience? If so, did Apple refuse to repair on the grounds that it's impossible to prove they did it? Did they offer a gift card or some other kind of compensation? I could find very few relevant posts that aren't like a decade old.

(The lesson here: always check your device thoroughly in-store when you pick it up from a repair. Learn from my mistake!)

Edit: Just to clarify, the scratch is on the component that was replaced during the repair (the top case), so unfortunately taking photos of the device before sending it in would have been futile.

Edit 2: Thanks for the replies everybody. I tried calling but they seem to be absurdly busy, so I’ve booked the soonest possible appointment on Wednesday. Will update afterwards.

Edit 3: Good news! They offered to replace the top case again free of charge. The technician didn’t even ask to see the photos I took last week - they just took my word for it.",Apple scratched my Macbook during repair,0.83,59,29,carbon1200

apple,"Assume that all products are ready to go and there are no part shortages. You clearly can’t launch all products at once.  What order would YOU launch everything in if your only goal was to maximize revenue?

Apple Silicon:  

Apple’s education discount runs to the end of the month.  Does that indicate that no new models will arrive before October?  

Which model do you launch?  MacBook Pro at a higher MSRP but with a high launch performance expectation?  MacBook 12” at a lower MSRP but customers would be OK with iPad Pro-like performance. 

iPhone:  If you can’t launch all 4 at the same time do you launch the least desirable first?  How many people talked themselves into a launch iPhone 8 Plus but sold it a month later when iPhone X?  I can honestly say as an iPhone 11 Pro Max owner - if they  launch the 5.4” in September and the 6.7” Max Pro in November I’d probably end up owning both.

Apple Watch:  Since this looks to be an incremental upgrade do you launch first before the iPhone even if iPhone was ready because at this point people are itching to buy SOMETHING!

iPad: 

If you have a new pro ready why would you release it less than a year from the latest models?

If you have a new iPad Air would you launch it before October 1?  I can’t imagine they want to subsidize that model with free AirPods?

AppleTV:

Gaming is the next thing to conquer.  Are you ready to launch a new platform because Apple Arcade is pretty lame.  If you’re not ready for the next big thing then what would we need a new ATV for?

HomePod: 

How can you launch an HopePod that’s significantly more attractive than the current HomePod at $199 every other weekend at Best Buy.  Do you launch a rebranded Beats Pill with HomeKit/SIRI capability?

apple,"The future of Apple?

My prediction/personal wish-list. 

The key change here is going to be a paradigm shift in the way we think about our Apple devices and the importance of our Apple accounts. A truly fundamental change to how people perceive computers. 

With the introduction of the ARM chips Apple is going to double down on the “ecosystem” and feed it some steroids. 

Everyone has a phone, everyone. Lots of individuals or family’s now have multiple computers, desktops and laptops, iPads, sometimes one each sometimes a shared one. We all use them differently and for different reasons. 

Those reasons are more than ever based around the size of the screen.

One that fits in your pocket and goes everywhere and gets scrolled all day.

One that’s big enough to watch YouTube or Netflix on or look at photos on, and edit with logical touch input, but small enough to do so on the couch or in a cafe, with no power hampering portable woes of the past.

Or one that’s large enough to professionally appraise and edit 4K footage with close scrutiny or play REAL GAMES in higher detail (with the unification of architecture across iOS and Mac OS devices and software it would be silly for developers to not start accessing the wanting base of gamers that own Apple computers)

No matter the size, all of the screens will be similar in their high end specs. Expect 120hz, mini-LED, HDR, retina dpi.All “Apple calibrated” to some new marketing term level of consistency and colour accuracy. AppleView certified screen?

All devices, whether they have a folding keyboard attached, a seperate full size wireless keyboard, whether it’s attached to a stand or wether it’s just a screen in your pocket they will all share a super minimalist, thin-bezeled slate look.

All accessories can work wirelessly with any device. Seamlessly. I don’t need to look at another Bluetooth settings menu. Make it easier for me. Push Apple device button, all local Apple devices have a screen prompt (W1 chip?). Push the prompt on screen and then interact with device to connect. Disconnect at any time in the devices settings menu. 

They’ll all basically be a slate screen with an under screen Face ID system and shared camera (selfie camera only) hardware for picture consistency. IPhones and iPads will have underscreen Touch ID, iPads on both ends for easy pick up and go.

Laptops and desktops will have keyboard based Touch ID. iPad selfie camera will be  moved to a side position but Face ID will work vertically or horizontally, either way up or down, as long as you don’t happen to cover the camera whilst holding. And the angle and distance that Face ID works at is greatly improved. 

The Apple account will become the unifying factor. If you have an Apple device you must have an Apple account. They will unify the ecosystem even further. Hardware simply existing as different methods to access the same photos, files and signed in accounts.

First boot up of any device presents with a new user or existing user option. Further accessed within a “device accounts” sub menu in systems settings if you wish to add more people or find the currently registered accounts and their password protected details. While “add user” or the initial sign in process is activated the device is connected to an Apple encrypted server through some special implementation using a new t3 chip, common to all devices, which allows face recognition or Touch ID recognition instantly, on any device (using internet) to add your account. No clunky email log in trying to remember your password. Though Apple will implement something special recommendations around master passwords and secure access methods for account rescue. 

This is their bigger picture. This is the future. They will truly unify the ecosystem and user experience between products. You purchase your device to suit your size and use case requirements. But all your devices access the same files and shared apps where they exist. (Apps Can be toggled per device)

All of the newly unified-styling hardware will come with a limited amount of SSD storage 1TB lower spec and 5TB higher spec, which honestly is more than enough for most average users. Same hardware storage across phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, everything. But all of your devices are accessing your exact same account, files, apps, everything. 

You have unlimited online storage. FREE. It’s just part of having both an Apple account and an Apple device. Firstly, free storage has a fair and reasonable policy to stop abuse or commercial use. This storage isn’t accessed through a seperate website or app, it isn’t accessed anywhere specifically. It’s just your files. All of your files are automatically on all of your devices. Online. 

You can simply right click on a desktop or long press on a touch device (inside a new file browser app. Apple style on iOS and iPad OS). So you can selectively keep files local+online or even only local if you choose. This will all have special Apple encryption and total data anonimization. Their focus on security including hardware and software recently indicates this is a real concern and they’re taking it seriously. 

Devices can be toggled as shared devices. Family computers or iPads. Shared devices sleep to a user ID page with a simple UI. Probably memojis with names underneath. Press one of the user icons and with just a face scan or finger print it immediately opens to their custom desktop / app layout / file structure. All seamlessly. This is done through some AI optimised file storage of most accessed files that aren’t tagged as local but are actually being stored locally for frequent access, under a layer of local encryption. On device. With the T3 chip. In ALL new devices.

This being the always online nature of our computers and devices now anything that isn’t recognised as frequently used or stored locally can be accessed quicker than ever before through the internet anyway. 

Automatically shared health stats between devices. Heart rate, steps, sleep tracking, and a new focus on wellbeing around screen use. Apple want to creature the technology of the future, but they do more than many to make sure that future is as healthy as possible. 

Tighter integration between “phone book” and messages, and social accounts to give you a useful reference for any contact point to everyone you know. Extra details shared for people with Apple accounts. Messages to become closer to a Facebook messenger. 

Apple in a way will become your social media account. It’ll be used to log into other websites and apps and you never need a password. This is already happening. It will be your hardware account. And increasingly your content accounts as well, expect them to all be rolled into one Apple account with sub options and sub packages that aren’t all seperate products, just options.

apple,"As you can see the name of the app is Not Phở, but it is not meant to deter people. It is a play on the fact that many people only know about Phở when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine, so I wanted to introduce many of the other dishes that I grew up with that are equally delicious if not more. Each recipe has an introduction to what the dish or component is, along with step by step instructions on how to prepare, cook, and enjoy the meal. Additionally, they are all presented using beautiful illustrations and interactive animations. There are also notes and tips along the way to help make the cooking process fun and easy. 

Not Phở fully supports VoiceOver, several Accessibility features, and is localized in English and Vietnamese. I plan to add more recipes and localizations in the future. Not Phở is available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

That does not take into account the 22% VAT that we have to pay in Italy, though, so I recalculated the American price, multiplying by 1.22. That gives a result of €2473, which is still a €330 difference that I cannot explain.

TimeKeep is an app that serves as an all-in-one time manager. You can time your day to see what you spend your time on, plan tasks or assignments, and create routines to fulfill everyday.

All data is completely locally stored (I don't keep track of your data - that would be weird!).

This is my first app - I first uploaded it to the app store six months ago, and for the past six months, I've been completely revamping my design, re-coding everything, and adding in new features, using suggestions from friends, family, and reddit.

I would love to hear your guys' suggestions for any new features, design changes, or anything in general!

apple,"# Disclaimer:

YES!! YES!! This is all speculation and is my personal opinion. VERY OBVIOUSLY I don't know if this will ever come to fruition. However, if it does, then the ARM era for Apple will be the biggest move they will make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# So let's start with something simple.

""What's a Computer?"". For ordinary people, a computer is an input and output device. Simple right? Well for Apple, it's an iPad. 

Now we know that Apple has been trying to make the iPad a Computer (more of a laptop) replacement for years, and good on them. I mean it's a neat idea. But it didn't go so well so far now has it..

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's where my theory comes in. I believe Apple will ""merge"" iPad and Macbook.

Yes, it sounds crazy but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

# The facts we know:

1. The new MacBooks will run on an Apple chip, which will obviously run the next iPhones and iPads.
2. Due to fact 1, MacOS is now supporting ARM architecture.
3. BigSur has many features that hint at a touchscreen, despite the MacBook not having one.
4. The reason iPad isn't a good PC replacement is because of iPadOS.
5. Apple wants MacOS to resemble IOS as much as possible, maybe even make them the same

# 

# Now, why tho?

Why would Apple, a company wildly known for their amazing hardware and software design, make an OS which is more useable with a touchscreen than with a touchpad/mouse?

Well, I think they mislead us.

I mean, a MacBook which is so similar to an iPad power-wise and portability-wise? Why would you make these two devices but give them a completely different software experience? It does seem dumb, doesn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

# The more technical:

Now, Hackintosh has been a thing for forever. It's a cool project to do if you have the time. 

But a thing about operating systems, an OS will run on ANY CPU you put it on as long as:

1. The CPU is powerful enough
2. The CPU architecture is the one that the OS is designed to run on

Now with that in mind, what exactly is stopping people from installing the ARM macOS on an iPad? Well, nothing really, I mean, both are ARM architectures. Plus, ARM macOS will be able to run IOS and iPadOS natively. So the support is there.

&amp;#x200B;

# The big picture:

Now I think Apple knows people will do that, and I believe Apple will make the MacBook and iPad line like so:

MacBook running macOS and iPad running the same macOS.

It's really a genius move if you think about it, taking your entire, DESKTOP Adobe library? On the go? Who the fck doesn't want that? And the next iPad will come with the same (ish) CPU that the ARM MacBook will have. So it all adds up.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the MacBook and iPad line will be like this:

Want a good and affordable device? Here's an 800$ MacBook for you.

Want a better device that has a touch screen, pen AND FaceID? Here, a more expensive iPad.

And both will perform the same tasks, just depends on what you need.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus it makes more sense when you think that macOS BigSur is designed with touch in mind, so put it on an iPad, it works perfectly. But put it on a MacBook, still works perfectly!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it is all theories, but if it's true, then man are we about to go into a whole new Apple era.

An era where they may become dominant amongst all.

User Created Folders max out at displaying 9 apps and swiping right to left to see additional pages of apps, while App Library Folders displays 28 apps and allows the user to scroll downward to see more apps.  This experience is smoother than swiping through pages of apps and shows more information.

apple,"[NikooPlayer](https://apple.co/2TYltuq) is not only a good offline music player, but it could be a handy practice tool for musicians also. Here are some examples on how you can use it for your practices:

* **Practice Section by Section:** How you eat an Elephant? One bite at a time.This is so true about practicing a complicated piece of music. Our *Jump Board* is a perfect tool for this. You can easily navigate through your music, select the section you want to practice, loop it, and then go to next section.
* **Start Slow:** Starting to practice with slower speeds is also one of key lessons that every musicians know. But most of the time, your options are limited to 1x, .75x, .5x. But usually we need more precise control on this and most of music players simply don't have this capability. NikooPlayer could give you precise control on playback speed from -8x to +8x with .01x precision! So you can start with what speed that you are comfortable with, and then progress gradually to higher speeds.
* **Listen to your practice:** listening to your own practice recordings is a good idea to see how good you are doing, but usually it is not so effective as our brain used to it and it is hard for us to see our own mistakes. One way to overcome this problem, is to listen to your practice with different pitch and speed, this will pivot your brain as if you are listening to someone else practice and suddenly you can see your mistakes. Our *pitch-speed control tab* is a perfect tool for this and you can adjust these two aspects at the same time to find the best combination. This is the same technique drawing artists are using to see their pitfalls, they usually flip their drawings left and right to see it from different angle.
* **Sing Along:** singing along could be challenging when you are not alone and we all know how we sound if we try to sing while we are wearing an headphone. We have designed a sing along feature that could allow you to sing along with your song while you are wearing an headphone and still sound good.

Thank you so much for your time for reading this self promo content. *NikooPlayer* is available only for iOS devices now and you can try its free version that includes all of its features with some limitations on number of songs.",NikooPlayer would improve your music practice,0.56,3,0,rshakiba

apple,"I absolutely love apple. Their technology has changed the game for me. I’ve been an Apple rider since the iPhone 4 was released to Verizon. 

My MacBook, iPhone, Mac mini, and iPad all connect and make it so easy to move from device to device. The iPhone 11 Pro is a beautiful creation and with the new iOS 14 beta, I’ve fallen back in love with their design. 

The Big Sur beta fell on its face IMO, because it ruined VS Code for me, something I need every day so I couldn’t keep it loaded. However, the UI is absolutely beautiful. There are subtle changes that make it so gorgeous, to me, that I cannot wait for the public release. 

Purple is my favorite color and rumor shows a dark blue / purplish iPhone coming out. Color me excited, son!

Some may call me an apple simp, some may call me a cult follower, and others may call me downright silly. But, Apple, take my money. Your privacy is top-notch and one of the selling points for me. 

Apple Music? Catch me spending my $$$ on your subscription. iCloud? Catch me spending $$ on 500gb of storage (while complaining about the cost).

iPhone upgrade program? Catch me diving into a new lease every major release (no S devices here). 

What is everyone most excited for with this event coming? For me, it’s the new phones &amp; the public releases of Big Sur and iOS 14.

[ThoughtJots](https://josephkimdesign.com/thoughtjots) (for a brief visual at how my app works)

Journaling can be... weird. Digital journaling? Definitely weird.

It's apparent that during COVID I've spent a lot of time with thoughts swirling around in my head. Reduced social interaction, toxic online melting pots, and spurts of anxiety have really taken its toll on me. I even stopped journaling because - hey, every day looks the same now, right?

But maybe journaling doesn't have to take itself so seriously. Everyday's high, low, and everything in between is worth mentioning. I made a light-hearted, fresh journaling experience that removes the pressure of looking perfect on paper.

ThoughtJots is a prompt based digital journal that helps users write more naturally. It presents the user with randomized statements where the user is expected to ""fill in the \_\_\_\_\_ "" regarding their day. The user can skip prompts or expound, it's all up to the user, whether they find prompts relevant or not.

The point is that the user can express their thoughts by jotting them down in a self-conversing manner without racking their brains. Afterwards or even during, the user can pull up a draft overview of their current writing session to make refinements.

We're going to look back on 2020 and remember what the heck it was all about, really.

\---

\*\*\*If you never clicked with writing journals... I'd love to know if you can jive with this. Give it a shot and let me know!

On House Hunters, you often hear buyers mention things like “sweat equity” or that they’re getting a deal because they’ll boost the value by renovating. 

I find it patently absurd that you would make that type of assumption with the supposed largest purchase of your life.

So here’s EquiFi - an app I built to show ROIs of various home renovation projects and do the math for you on what that will likely do to your home’s value. 

i’ve been a lurker on r/apple for over ten years, and I know this sub has high standards and expectations for products, so I’m hoping to get your feedback on this app!

[NikooPlayer](https://apple.co/2TYltuq) has a lot of tools that allows you to apply precise changes to playback speed and pitch of the audio or song. This include ready to use tool bars and a powerful pitch-speed control pad that actually enables you to change both (playback) speed and pitch at the same time so you can land on right place much easier.

Then you can add a little bit reverb and may be a 3D effect to make the audio more pleasant.

NikooPlayer can automatically list all of your locally stored music, podcasts (downloaded one), audio books, playlists, and you can also copy any other audio file from any other source to it or use airdrop feature on you iOS device.

[NikooPlayer](https://apple.co/2TYltuq) is available only for iOS devices  now and the basic version includes all of its features but we have limited the number of songs and albums.

apple,"Airplay 2 was supposed to fix most of the annoying things about Airplay 1 (Play to multiple targets, calls interrupting, allowing you to start a stream on device, hand it off to target, and then do something else on your phone).  It does the first thing two things well, but I can't determine how it does the last thing (ie. handoff).  Im not sure if its up to individual apps to support it or if its a system feature, Im using airplay wrong, or I had a misunderstanding about airplay 2.  One of the biggest gripes about airplay was that when airplaying something, browsing to a site with video, and then having that video audio come out airplay, interrupting your original airplay stream.  That doesn't seem to be fixed, unless the video is a youtube video.

3 Examples - 

I can start a song in Apple Music, airplay it to my Sonos One (which is Airplay 2 compatible)... If I then open Podcasts and play a podcast it takes over the ""now playing"" card in Control Center and goes to my Move, stopping my music stream.   I couldn't find a way to have a podcast play locally and apple music continue to play on an airplay target since there is only the one now playing card in control center.

Netflix does the same thing.  If I start a netflix video it takes over now playing and comes out the move.

Youtube does not, however I can't control youtube volume independently from the airplay 2 speaker... so if I turn up the video volume on my phone (hardware buttons or GUI), it also turns up the airplay 2 volume, but at least the audio streams are different between airplay 2 target and locally.

The problem seems less an Airplay issue, more that there is only one audio source at a time, yet somehow phone calls and youtube manages to get around it.",Airplay 2 Handoff Functionality?,0.93,37,17,buddyrich33
apple,"I know we’ve seen plenty threads on this, and some of this be rehash, but I don’t think many people (developers / consumers / Epic) have thought this all through:

WHAT CONSUMERS GAIN:

* Emulators and many some pretty awesome software that apple won’t allow (see: XCloud).
* Options. You have the option to find lower rates and have apps that take more liberties with your phone (for better or for worse). Cheaper rates definitely sounds nice, and I’m sure some people will even find ways to take advantage of the new $free.99 pricing structure. Personally, I might be one of those people in the latter category because....

WHAT CONSUMERS LOSE:

* Less guarantees on privacy. If developers don’t have to put up with this headache, they won’t.
* Less applications using Apple sanctioned API’s and going to other stores to avoid App Store review. This may mean more variety, but I think it’ll more likely lead to inconsistencies, developers not supporting Apple API’s as much as they do now, overall decline in app quality and polish, less system optimizations, etc.
* More companies potentially having access to your credit cards / payment information. You’re losing a single channel for many channels.
* Alternative stores hoarding exclusives to force you into their store. PC gamers know all too well that if Epic Games gets a store on iOS they’ll be buying exclusives left and right. Expect Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, social media, etc. to whore themselves out to Epic Games because they don’t even want to be under Apple’s privacy thumb in the first place.
* No sign-in with Apple ID. Many more apps requesting payment details to circumvent the app store and many more apps requesting you make accounts with them w/o a secure and private single sign-on.
* Less protections against malware and less recourse on being made whole should something screw with your system (as it stands, Apple gives out a refund if you just request it).
* A less cohesive ecosystem. You can’t have one app purchase run across all your devices unless the other store you’re buying from is on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac.

WHAT DEVELOPERS GAIN

* More freedom. They can do whatever the fuck they want within reason (for better or for worse). Don’t like their privacy stances? Fuck you, they’ll make their APK available solely from their website with all of the offending code that Apple wouldn’t permit. But on the bright side, we will get more capable software that can interact and make positive system changes as well. Think different themes for your phone and non-native music apps being default. Say hello to tweaks.
* Potentially more revenue (but I don’t think this will happen unless you’re a rather large dev with custom DRM).
* All those apps that Apple denies for arbitrary reasons? They’re now all permissible (again, for better or for worse).

WHAT DEVS LOSE:

* Strong piracy protections. This one will hurt their bottom lines in ways I don’t think they’re expecting. And personally, as a dev, I wouldn’t blame a consumer if they tried to pirate my work if that option became much more viable. I fully expect a non-walled garden experience to be coupled with less privacy protections and a general decline in app quality. Devs will want to use platform agnostic API’s much more, and that will result in less optimized apps. People will want to shotgun any and everything between Android and iOS. And if this prediction is correct, I couldn’t blame a consumer for wanting the apps to be free. Hell, you want my data and you want to charge me for a crappier experience where I have to go and download your custom launcher for this one app? You better believe I’m searching for a free alternative. There’s a reason app developers make more money on iOS... Apple customers are forced and conditioned to go through official channels as unofficial ones are much more difficult. Open those barriers a bit, and I think you’ll see people aren’t so happy to pay a similar amount.
* Apple may resort to pettiness and just charge for their tools. I personally doubt this will happen because it might affect their hardware sales should there be less devs, but I’m sure that they’ll find a way to restructure their business to retain some form of a cut (or at least try to).
* Smaller-to-medium sized developers will have to put up with much more overhead should they leave the app store. Again, that’s their choice, but I don’t think they realize the value provided here by Apple. Hosting, payment processsing, online dispute resolution, translation services, global tax services, world-class API’s and tools, free advertising, customer install base, handling of credit card processing fees, etc. Perhaps this isn’t worth 30% any more, and I agree that the rate should be scrutinized, but it’s definitely worth at least 20%. These are pretty low rates (even 30%) when you look at the cost structure of pretty much any other industry. The fee is also in-line with their competitors and has remained static since the store’s inception. This isn’t even considering that Apple may put much less resources into this store should all the bigger players leave. If they’re not getting a cut of Prime Video subscriptions, why would they invest so much money into app review, curation, etc. for small indie devs. I think the rate on larger devs (and the app store in general) ultimately levels the playing field for smaller people.
* Free app store advertising. Your app won’t be featured on those large, fancy articles in the Today View that have reportedly made app developer’s careers. There are other methods of advertising, of course, but be prepared to see smaller and medium sized devs get further lost in the race unless someone fills this gap for cheap or free.

WHAT EPIC GAINS:

* More opportunities to sell make believe IAP to children with less overhead and less scrutiny.
* More weight behind their store, which they’d try to pivot into being everywhere. They may see this as a way to combat Steam more effectively by pitching their services as being home and mobile instead of just stuck on PC.

WHAT EPIC GAMES LOSES:

* Probably a lot of IAP. They’ve already been shown to struggle on Android trying to sell Fortnite direct, but maybe the stars will align and their fortunes will change?

* Business model scrutiny. If we can arbitrarily define monopolies as anything we want, I’m sure someone will want to define Epic’s control over the Fortnite marketplace as monopolistic in order to take advantage and sell wares.",A discussion on what we lose and gain should Epic Games be permitted to have their own store...,0.8,128,123,vorheehees

apple,"TLDR:

Step 1: Openly invite Google Stadia, Playstation Now, GeForce Now, and SteamLink services onto the Xbox platform.

Step 2: Launch xCloud on the web but require the Edge browser (incl the iOS version of Edge, for which an update will be submitted to Apple including xCloud + controller support) for it to work.

Long version:

Step 1: 

Both Apple and Microsoft have both Open and Closed software platforms - for Apple, the Mac is open (can sideload any software via official means), and iOS is closed. For Microsoft, Windows is open, the Xbox is closed. The only argument Apple can make right now is that they are -as fair- as Microsoft is on their own closed platform. Saying “But iCloud apps are on the Windows marketplace!” is Apples to Oranges. 

Microsoft could immediately invalidate this argument by openly inviting Google Stadia, Playstation Now, GeForce Now, and SteamLink (and any others I’m missing) onto the Xbox, and if they really wanted to be boss about it, they could publicly offer terms to those companies that are smaller cuts (or no cut!) than Apple’s infamous 30%.

The best part is, those companies don’t even need to actually follow through and make the apps (though some certainly would) in order for Microsoft to score this leverage. Just by openly inviting it, Apple (and those defending them) can no longer say “but they’re treating iOS no differently than MS is treating Xbox”.  Boom.

Step 2:

Apple explicitly said in their statements ‘If you want to go around the App Store, use the web’ so take them up on the offer. xCloud probably isn’t possible on Safari in iOS (not sure if iOS Game Controller inputs pass thru to Safari, and there is probably some local code being executed for xCloud streaming to work, even if its mostly just a video stream).  But Microsoft already makes a browser on iOS - Edge. They could submit to Apple an update to Edge that adds controller support and whatever else code xCloud needs, and then tell people “Go to xbox.com in the Edge browser to sign in and stream xCloud over the web!”.

Apple could - and probably would, knowing them - reject the app update. But Microsoft doesn’t have to be quiet about it. And the fact that Apple said “do it over the web” and now Microsoft are trying to do just that and Apple are *STILL* blocking them makes Apple’s position impossibly weak.

Do both together? And do an aggressive ad campaign in partnership with Samsung not only selling xCloud on Galaxy S20 but also - right in the ad - saying “You can’t do this on your iPhone, Apple won’t let you”.",If I were Microsoft this is what I would do to force Apple’s hand and get Game Pass streaming on iOS,0.27,0,38,Kiggsworthy

Hey r/Apple!

I'm decently active in this community, but for those of you who I haven't said hi to, I'm an iOS app developer, I used to work at Apple and now for the last several years I've built [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), an awesome Reddit app for iOS that I built with the goal of ""what would it look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app?"". 

### What's going on today?

Today it's my 27th birthday, and I want to raise a bunch of money for the SPCA Animal Shelter and a bunch of animals that are going through some rough times. Heck, I want to go a step further and break the all-time single day donation record. **So for today, 100% of Apollo's proceeds are going to the SPCA.**

If you buy literally anything in the app like Apollo Pro, I'll donate 100% of the proceeds to the SPCA, so it's a great day if you even have a passing interest in Apollo. If you already have unlocked things in Apollo, boy do I have a treat for you! A lot of people have been asking for an ""animals/pets"" style homescreen icon option for Apollo, and today I released a ""stealth update"" that has an all new SPCA themed icon commissioned by the absolutely incredible [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/). It's so gorgeous, [I love how it turned out](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png). Not only today, but literally for every day forever, 100% of the proceeds for this will go to the SPCA. You get the icon, some wallpapers, and even an exclusive Apollo Community Pets Photo Album included. There's even another Easter egg if you unlock it. 

If you want to go the direct route instead (or in addition) that would be amazing too! I created a direct fundraiser page: https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/apollo-app-2020-spca-fundraiser/ This is doubly awesome if you have an employer who donation-matches to charities. Seriously, I know a lot of people are like ""hurr durr every dollar counts"" but no bullshit, it **really** does here. Think of the size of this community, 1.6 million people. If even a small percentage of them gave a single dollar we could make a massive difference. 

### What's an ""Apollo""? It's a different Reddit app?

If you're happy with the official app and have no idea what Apollo is, that's totally cool. I wasn't really perfectly happy with any of the iOS Reddit app offerings out there (especially with Alien Blue's passing). The official app in particular (while built by some insanely smart people whom I have a ton of respect for) I think tries to toe the line between a single experience across their Android and an iOS apps more than I like, so I really wanted to create an iOS-first Reddit experience that felt at home on iOS, built for speed, power features, and insanely great media consumption. It's free to download and use!

It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer, Smart Portrait Lock, and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/24/apollo) as well as [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/), with over 2 million downloads and over 100K 5-star reviews.

### Why right now?

These warm months are dubbed ""[kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/)"" by shelters, because it's the time of the year that all the cats like to give birth. So the shelters get a sudden massive influx of a ton of orphaned and surrendered (and sometime left to die) kittens and it massively drains their resouces like food. This is amplified by the COVID pandemic where a lot less people have been able to gets their pets neutered, and adoptions have lessened due to people staying inside. So it's a really, really hard time of the year and they (and the animals they're helping) are really in need of the help.

They're also special for me because it's where I rescued my two cats. Pet tax photo album: https://imgur.com/a/q9cL7t6

So yeah, if you enjoy my work at all, or like animals at all, or want me to have a good birthday, or just want some happiness in this otherwise crappy year, it would really mean the world to me if you could check out any of the above links and help out the shelter. The donation record for a single day [is $27,355 that we set last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cg11x7/i_dont_even_know_how_to_title_this_typing_from/), but I really really want to beat it this year! I think with the combination of the new icon, Apollo having more users than ever, and the direct donation option, we can do it.

I'll of course keep you all posted once I find out how much Apollo raised by tomorrow! In the meantime I'd love to hang around and talk if you have any questions or insights or just want to share pet pics haha.
