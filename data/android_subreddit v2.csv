Android,"As long as you use the OneNote Desktop App (not the UWP), everything is great. Everything works fine. It's a great app for creating and storing notebooks.  

However, opening the same notes on an Android phone or tablet is an exercise in banging my head over and over again against a table.     

----

###Font Support

The font support in Android is paltry. This means any notes typed in fonts other than the (very) few available on Android will revert to Calibri. This is especially problematic for programme code or music notations made in fonts like Lucida Console to maintain spacing.   

###Script Glitches

As long as one types in English or other common Roman scripts, the text is at least somewhat legible. Moving to other scripts results in a disaster, where combined letters are not properly represented and appear disjoint with glitched markers everywhere.  
 
[Example Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneNote/comments/i2vj6l/its_not_a_bug_its_a_feature_limitation/g0797z3/)   

This does not occur on any other apps: Office or otherwise. Often after OneNote updates, these glitches appear and disappear in different notes based on evidently what the AI's mood is like, or whether the text was directly typed into OneNote (the desktop app) or copied from Word/Excel to OneNote (again on desktop).  

This glitch also regularly occurs on the 'OneNote for Windows 10' app, but luckily I never have to use that again.  

###Text Reflow

Text reflow is a nightmare. Samsung Notes does it well, and so does Microsoft word, where they reflow to adapt to the screen size and don't bounce around. OneNote also does this in theory, but it still retains some padding beyond the screen area which results in the text bouncing around and often overflowing beyond the edges of the screen unless one moves their finger slowly and precisely all the time. There is no (obvious) way to lock this. Here are the video screenshots of notes on Samsung Notes, Word, and OneNote, all typed on Windows and opened on Mobile:

- [Microsoft Word](https://i.imgur.com/Lj4dNai.mp4)  
- [OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/cmOSVk6.mp4)  

-----

This is a pity, because OneNote otherwise offers me personally the simplest option for a platform-agnostic Notes app, has decent pen support options, and synchronises with OneDrive. I don't even think these are difficult things to fix. The former two are not a problem in other Office 365 apps, and the latter is a feature of probably every other note or text app on the Play Store.

Android,"I know the big thing right now is the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and no one cares about the Fold 1 now, but I still thought this was worth sharing. This is more of an impressions post than a review, and I won't be going into depth about benchmarks or camera performance, since there's already a ton of content about that from the past year. My main focus is what it was like to use my first folding phone. Expect this to be full of personal opinions that you probably disagree with. And expect this to be very ranty/stream-of-consciousness.

**Phone history**

1. iPhone 3G (purchased 2010)
2. Moto G 2013 (purchased 2013)
3. Zenfone 2 (purchased 2015)
4. Xperia X Compact (purchased 2016)
5. Pixel 3 (purchased 2018)
6. Galaxy Fold 1 (purchased 2020)

**Why the hell did I buy an old first gen product?** I wanted to try out the whole folding phone thing. I found this on Swappa for $825, which I thought was a fair price, especially since it still has 3 years of security patches left. 

**But isn't the front screen shitty?** Yeah, kinda. But I actually prefer the smaller front display because it's actually usable one-handed. I do wish it were just a tiny bit bigger though--maybe enough to shrink the side bezels. I really dislike how Samsung made the Fold 2 bigger physically instead of just filling out the front display. [This is a picture I made a couple of years ago about my frustration with the evolution of phone design, and I thought it was relevant with the changes from the Fold 1 to the Fold 2](https://i.imgur.com/nvoevwy.png). 

I have a few more thoughts on the front display:

* I would say 80% of the time, I want a phone the size of the smaller iPhones (e.g., iPhone 5), and 20% of the time, I want a tablet, so the Fold 1 is actually working pretty nicely for my personal use cases. Most of my phone usage consists of feeling the phone vibrate (or getting an alert on my watch), taking it out to type up a quick response, and putting it back in my pocket, and I can actually type one-handed!
* I was frustrated when I couldn't use split screen with the front display. But then I found out FNG lets you set up a gesture for split screen, and it works with the front display, so that's what I've been using.

**How's the software?** I mean, as far as the front vs inner display thing is concerned, it works as you'd expect. The main jank is that some apps operate differently depending on the screen size. So if I open Chrome on the front display, it'll use the phone UI, and if I open it on the inner display, it'll use the tablet UI, which is expected, but if I open it on the front display and then open up the phone, it'll continue using the phone UI, and vice versa. But for my uses, this stuff is nbd (insert BoJack Horseman reference here).

Additional thoughts on software:

* This is my first Samsung phone, and honestly, my first impression was that One UI is extremely ugly. I'm Korean, so I should be able to ""get"" their approach to design, but it still leaves a really bad taste in my mouth. After installing Nova Launcher and changing some of the icons, I can stomach it a lot better, but it's still not great. That said, I'm not someone who cares too much about UI aesthetics, so it's something I can tolerate. 
* Samsung bloat is real. I used adb to delete Facebook and LinkedIn, but that doesn't account for Samsung's system apps. Personally, I use Google to sync my files, photos, and contacts, so I ended up installing Google apps for Drive, Photos, Contacts, etc., leaving me with Samsung duplicates that I can't uninstall (if anyone can tell me how to safely uninstall them, please let me know). Thankfully Nova Launcher lets you hide apps from the app drawer, and this phone comes with a whopping 512 GB storage, so it should be fine. That said, I do understand that if someone wants to use their Samsung account to sync their stuff between phones, and they upgrade from an older Galaxy to a Pixel, they might find the ""Google bloat"" to be frustrating for them as well. I just wish they'd let you use whatever account/services you want instead of preloading their stuff on your phone. 
* I still can't get weather info to appear on the AoD. I tried turning it on under FaceWidgets but it still won't show up.
* It seems like I can't remove the persistent notification for AdGuard, which is kinda annoying.
* When I found out Nova Launcher just duplicates your home screens on the smaller front display, I thought it would be really ugly, but it turns out for my setup, it looks fine. [And I'm one of those weirdos who has six apps on their dock](https://i.imgur.com/MlZX90a.png). 

**Durability, build quality, physical design, etc.**

* The phone is a rather bad combination of heavy and slippery. I ended up picking up a case for it. It comes in two parts, to clip onto the front and the back. Unfortunately it seems like every case I could find for this obstructs a big portion of the front, keeping you from swiping in from the bezels (e.g., swiping up to go to the home screen). So I just use the back cover and leave the front unprotected. Which is really all I need for grip anyway. 
* I've heard a lot of people complaining about how the plastic inner screen feels mushy, but it's not something I've noticed. 
* The speakers are really easy to cover up and muffle in landscape mode unless you use it ""upside-down"" (I'm calling it upside-down because that's how the phone expects you to use it in landscape mode by default).
* The notch is definitely annoying. I really wish there were a way to watch fullscreen video with the image just a bit zoomed out so it doesn't go into the notch.
* There are two gaps along the hinge on the back of the phone where I'm constantly afraid that dirt or dust will get in. It's definitely big enough for that. But no issues so far ...

**Battery life, camera, performance, etc.**

* Most reviews cover this, so I'm not going to go into depth here.
* It's hard to gauge battery life because of the pandemic and working from home and all, but it's at least twice as good as my Pixel 3. 
* Daytime photos are great, as expected, but night time photos are unusable, regardless of whether I turn on night mode. But there's a GCam port, so I use that for taking pictures in the dark. 
* My Pixel 3 would constantly kick apps out of memory, but I don't think that's actually ever happened to me yet with the Fold. 

**Final thoughts**

* I wish instead of a notch, they went with something like they did with the S10 where there's a hole punch on the corner. Since most video is 16:9 or 21:9, it would mean that the front camera is not at all an issue when watching stuff full-screen. I also don't understand why they didn't do this with the Fold 2.
* Size-wise, this phone is perfect. [Just small enough for me to wrap my fingers around the entire phone while being able to reach keys on the far edge of the display when typing](https://i.imgur.com/v3mphI2.png). 
* Speaking of size (or well, more like physical dimensions), I think it would make far more sense if it folded out to landscape orientation. The inner display can be 4:3, so when folded, it would be 2:3, which isn't all that strange of an aspect ratio--it's what iPhones used before the iPhone 5. In fact, since the hinge takes up a bit of extra space, it would probably be more like 8:5 or 16:9, which is what we're all used to. But then I'm not a professional hardware engineer or designer, so what do I know.
* Overall, I'm happy with this. A more ""perfect"" version of this would be something with the same size/dimensions, except no notch, and smaller front bezels. 
* Well, I guess this wasn't so brief.

Android,"Over the past 7 years I've been using Android tablets for school. We all know their problems - little support from developers, short software support. These can be coped with by using split window mode and flashing custom ROM respectively. Recently after buying a Wear OS smartwatch I've decided to ditch my smartphone entirely and rely on this 5G Tablet + 4G Watch combo. I've been doing well, but some odd things happened along the way:

Samsung has explicitly chosen not to allow their own tablets (or any tablets for that matter) to pair with their own watches. On the setup screen of the Samsung Wearable app you choose which device you want to pair with. If the app is launched on a smartphone, you get to choose from all the Samsung wearables. If the exact same .apk is launched on a tablet, you can only choose their earbuds. Needless to say I had to return my Galaxy Watch and get the Huawei Watch 2 instead.

Furthermore, the Huawei Wear app could not be installed from Play Store at all - ""This item is not compatible with your device"" - downloading and installing the .apk from elsewhere proved otherwise and I was able to pair my watch.

Next up, Android Auto. Same story as with Huawei Wear - unavailable in the Play Store, working perfectly once installed from APKMirror.

The idea is to emulate the dopamine response of getting sporadic notifications from social networks, without actually being on social networks. It uses your contacts and gallery images as fake sources of content.

I don't think it's actually useful, but thought it was a pretty interesting thought experiment into whether they have the same effect. Would love to hear if there's any merit in the idea (and if it even works 😬)

Android,"Not sure this is the right place to post this but here goes.

If you are a WhatsApp user then you know that over time you'd accumulate a lot of phone numbers and eventually all those people will be able to view your WhatsApp profile. I mean sure there isn't much on it in the first place but paranoid as I am I'd still prefer a bit more privacy.

See WhatsApp uses your Contact list to populate it's own contact list for the app. So all your Google Contacts synced and stored on the phone are available in the app. However WhatsApp's privacy options are rubbish - you can choose to share your photo, last seen and about you with **Nobody, Contacts or Everyone** and that's it. Your **status alone gets extended options to share with or exclude selected contacts**.

That means, if you have a contact stored on your phone then you either hide your profile from everyone or you show it to everyone. There is no option to include/exclude certain contacts.

I do not enjoy handing my number out to people who I have casual dealings with, let's say a restaurant or store, and them being able to then access my WhatsApp profile.

So what do you do? If you give your number out to someone, save it for future contact with them then they have access to your WhatsApp profile. The alternative is you don't save their number to your contacts and risk losing it in the call log or store it by writing it down somewhere. Or have two numbers and only give your non-WhatsApp number to people. Or you outright block them on WhatsApp which may not always be possible if your communication is over WhatsApp.

There is no in-between unless WhatsApp decides to improve on their privacy options.

After searching for an answer for a few days and trying contacts sync between multiple Google accounts (spoiler: disabling sync only disables background sync, at some point you may accidentally manually sync and delete your contacts saved in the cloud), I was ready to give up when I saw that the web based Google Contacts app allows you to **hide contacts**:

[https://contacts.google.com/](https://contacts.google.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

So apart from finally taking a few hours to organize my contacts, I hid all the ones that I no longer need or want accessing my WhatsApp profile: [https://i.imgur.com/OrP0Nam.png](https://i.imgur.com/OrP0Nam.png)

You can also hide multiple contacts: [https://i.imgur.com/jFoq9OA.png](https://i.imgur.com/jFoq9OA.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The hidden contacts end up in the ""Other Contacts"" section:

[https://contacts.google.com/other](https://contacts.google.com/other)

&amp;#x200B;

They can be added back to your contacts list by using the ""Add to contacts"" option if desired.

After hiding all unnecessary contacts, I synced with my phone and voila! The only contacts on my phone now are the ones that are important. The rest are hidden, and thus cannot view my WhatsApp profile.

But doesn't that mean the contacts are no longer on your phone as well? Yes it does but they are still accessible albeit with a catch. Opening the **Contacts app** (not the Dialer) and searching will show you the contact **provided you are connected to the internet**. It will show up as ""Other Contacts"" under your gmail account.

[https://i.imgur.com/4W3C6yt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4W3C6yt.jpg)

From there you can call them or send an SMS. Further, if you get a call from a hidden contact and are connected to the internet, the caller's saved name will show up after the small bit of time it takes for the dialer to fetch it from your ""Other Contacts"".

Of course this only works if you have internet access in the first place but if you are using WhatsApp you likely would.

And rest assured you will have a way of contacting them in the future but also get some much needed extra privacy in today's world.

This should likely work for other apps that read your contacts to populate their ""find a friend"" lists like Snapchat, Telegram and whatever else the cool kids are using these days.

Gesture animations:

- When going home from an app that has no place to go on the home screen, the card animates significantly more smoothly into a circular shape then and disappears

- Apps can open into landscape (might be old)
- When going home from an app in landscape the launcher will stay in portrait (BIG CHANGE)
- Swipe up on any page to go to the first page
- Quickstep does not have the select button in recent apps for OCR

Other animations:
- Swiping between pages has a little bounce
- When removing an app from recent apps the next card will bounce into place. 

SystemUi Changes:

- Improved keyboard animations (to be fully utilized they need to be implemented by the developer) 
- The keyboard appears significantly faster
- Improved rotation animation
- Significantly improved screenshot animation
- When pulling down quick settings on the lock screen the media player will ""jump"" into place
- When setting a wallpaper it will slightly zoom in to facilitate the new animations

I'm certain their are way more under the hood refinements as the system as the system feels really smooth and fast for such an early build of a barebones ROM. 

In conclusion it feels really smooth and fast and I don't want to go back to Android 10 even though there are alot of ROM side issues. I do hope Google does add alot more features next time though.",Android 11 is a great step into the refinement of the OS,0.82,146,73,LankeeM9

Android,"I've been using Nearby Share for months, because I was on the Beta Google Play Services.

After all that time, what I really hate is that every company, and google itself, says that is a Fast Method to share files...but they didn't say how long it takes to share something.

I mean, first of all, you need to have Wifi, Location, and Bluetooth always on...but why???
Lemme explain, even if you want to share something using mobile data, it will make you turn on Wifi. The phone that will recieve the file will connect to you mobile data to make the WiFi-Direct share...but why do I have to turn it on if I'm sending it?

Second, Location...is totally USELESS. Everybody says ""You need it to find the other device"" ok...but that doesn't make sense when you also use Bluetooth.
Also, who goes with the location always on? If you want to share something you need to turn it on, and ask the other person to turn it on, it makes the process really annoying and makes you think ""Why am I doing this..I can send it via Whatsapp/Telegram Uncompressed""
You will need to turn it on every time you want to share/receive sth, because it will drain your battert if you leave it turned on the whole day.

Bluetooth has no problem with that, as it has the LE tech.

Android,"So I was just thinking about how to improve widgets on Android and came up with an idea that could create a multifaceted improvement between both Android's widgets and WearOS' complications. Essentially, I think that creating a single API that works concurrently for both platforms could expand the use cases and developer support for both platforms.

Apps would simply designate specific portions of their application's data sets along with a label of sorts to allow widgets and complications to aggregate the data into 3rd party widgets that are designed for the API and WearOS watch faces that support complications. 

This is more or less how the complications system works on WearOS already but the issue is the market isn't very saturated with WearOS users at the moment. Subsequently, complication support (though fairly simply for app developers to implement) isn't as widespread as it could be. By transposing the complication's system over to widgets on the Android side, application developers would have a significantly larger user base to cater to and would be much more likely to implement the new, cross-platform complication system into their apps. 

This could spark a resurrection in the widget space, with customizable widget apps being much more user friendly as a result. Users creating a custom widget could aggregate data from multiple sources by simply selecting the corresponding activity/complication from a list. 

Some use case ideas I have for this would be to create a ""control center"" esque widget similar to what iOS offers but with all your own custom complications. Toggling things from different manufacturers simultaneously like smart home switches/routines, wearable toggles (like the battery level/sound profile/ambient sound setting on a pair of wireless headphones), and having data aggregated like your current monthly data plan usage all in one cutomized widget panel would look pretty damn sleek in my opinion. Or maybe a fitness center that combines toggles for workouts, headphone setting, and health tracking data from various different apps/developers all into one widget would be a much cleaner look than having multiple, seperate widgets with varying designs all situated on a single page of your app launcher.

Much the same, assuming app developers enable this feature for their apps various toggles/data points due to widget support greatly expanding their use case scenarios and general usage overall, WearOS watches would have access to a ton more complications than before! Being able to say, have a watch face that has health data displayed from Google fit, weather data from an app like Dark Sky (yes, I know Dark Sky is gone), and some toggles for headphones (like toggles for ambient sound and enable/disable touch controls for bluetooth headphones like the Galaxy or Pixel buds) on a 3rd party WearOS watchface would be amazingly customizable and offer significantly more options than any other wearable platform does currently (honestly, WearOS is already the best at this). One could use this feature to aggregate their calendar app's next event onto the watchface of their choosing as well! 

What do you guys think? I can't imagine this sort of thing would be too difficult to implement and would be highly customizable for both widgets and complications if done correctly. There could be some conflictions at first (like a complication circle on a watchface being unable to display something like a calendar event, for example) but users could easily just change the setting to something else if an issue of this nature arises!",Interesting idea for both Android widgets and WearOS,0.68,19,6,gniguhcraig

I hope this post is not against the rules of this subreddit. 

I used to have terrible anxiety and depression so I have developed a app called Raah. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raahteam.raahtheapp

Sometimes we cannot focus on simple things and are blocked the entire day or maybe even weeks because we have something in our mind which is bothering us and we don't have the correct person to talk to without the fear of being judged. 

The purpose of this app is you can talk to someone and share out your frustrations, sorrows or just speak your mind.

You can also listen to someone who wants to be heard and feel glad that you just gave some time and attention to someone and made them feel better.. 

Despite having so much social media around do you feel you can truly express yourself or connect with someone.
 

All this happens while you remain anonymous. The app is purely text chat based no audio,video ,no image sharing, no meme's nothing. Just straight text to help conceal your identity.  

**Please Please bear with us , We know for every talker request 2 notifications goes and its annoying we are working on it. Do not uninstall the app for this you can disable the notifications, we have this option within the app.**


If you find any suspicious permissions please let us know we will remove it. So far we are using basic internet and notifications.  

**Known issues:** 

1. A person waiting for more than 2 minutes is ejected without any information

1. Sometimes for every talker request 2 notifications are sent. 

Note: 

1. I am aware this concept may have flaws, talking to a stranger is not ideal or advisable but for topics like breakup, job loss, feeling worthless it does help talk to someone and get motivated.   

1. Raah is not a replacement for suicide hotline / professional therapy/counselling. 

1. We just use the phone number for verifying if you are a real user and protecting users against  trolls. **If you guys have any ideas on how to protect this platform against trolls please reach out to us.** 

1. We plan to delete the chat data every 24 hours unless an incident is reported for moderation purpose. 

1. Raah at this stage does not support end to end encryption yet but we do want to add soon. 

1. We are still in beta right now consider things to be broken. If you find any bugs, have any suggestions or feedback do send us here 

1. We do want to be open source soon.",I have developed a app which is trying to help cope with depression. I am looking for beta testers,0.83,114,28,xpsdeset

Android,"Over the past 10 years, I've had the privilege of using every Samsung flagship phone (except for the S20). So, I was pretty excited to get my hands on the Note 20 Ultra and see how it compared to my Pixel 4XL and iPhone 11 Pro.

Here are some of my thoughts after using it for 3 weeks. [I also made a video review](https://youtu.be/UTVCcxKUBsI) (it's my first time making a tech video).

**The good**

* The screen is beautiful and the 120Hz refresh rate is an amazing addition this year to the note 20
* Performance is top notch and the 12GB RAM ensures you won't have to reload apps much
* Cameras are amazing. The main sensor has improved a lot and the low light performance is a big step up. The 50x zoom camera on the note 20 is really good in bright conditions, but it's not amazing in low light. Also, 50x is more of a gimmick. For best results, treat the 50x zoom lens as a 5x lens
* Build quality is great and the in-hand feel is amazing. The note 20 is a beautiful looking device and arguably one of the best phones Samsung has ever made
* The S-pen on the Note 20 Ultra is ultra smooth. The low latency really makes it feel like you're writing on paper (without the paper feel)
* The level of customization Samsung offers is really good! I LOVE Good Lock and I wish it was available on more devices
* Samsung Dex is a very underrated feature of the phone. Love the ability to connect it to a monitor and access my stuff that way. Due to lockdowns, there hasn't been a bigger need to use Dex, but I expect to use it a lot more while traveling

**The not(e) so good**

* The resolution of the screen must be dropped to 1080 in order to use 120Hz refresh rate on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which can be noticeable while reading a lot of text. I did get used to it after a couple days, but every time I went back to my Pixel 4XL or iPhone, I could tell the screens were sharper on those phones. I wish Samsung included a 90Hz option with full resolution
* The battery is good enough for one day, but would be nice to have a bit more buffer there 
* The 50x zoom camera could use a bigger sensor. The low light performance is not great, which limits the use case. I'd recommend only using when there's plenty of light available
* The phone requires you to use both hands to use comfortably. Depending on your preference, the large size of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can be a bit much 
* Software is a bit buggy. The gestures aren't as smooth as you'd find on a Pixel device. Sometimes, the navigation gestures stop working all-together, which can be a bit frustrating

Overall, it's pretty incremental upgrade over last year's note. It's still worth the $1300 USD if you want the latest and greatest, but you can definitely get similar features for a lot less (minus the S-pen).",Honest thoughts on the Note 20 Ultra after using it for 3 weeks,0.76,54,68,imzaeem

Android,"	I have been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4, but not exactly… avid. After the iPhone 8 and X came out, instead of upgrading to one of those, I just bumped up to the 6S. Finally this year, I was ready to get a new phone. I wasn’t quite ready for a 700-1100 dollar upgrade, so you can imagine my excitement when the SE 2nd generation came out. But… problems still arose.

	I decided to wait a bit, my friend had gotten the SE, and I waited to hear about his experiences before getting one of my own. After all, it was basically just the iPhone 8 with a year or two more updates, but for $150 dollars more. And I consider myself a tech guy, keeping up with it if not buying it all. So, the bezels the size of a parking lot were growing old to me, and no phone in 2020 should have them, even a mid-ranger. 

This is when I started considering leaving the realm of Apple and looking around at Android phones. I had a few options in mind- Samsung Galaxy A70, the OnePlus Nord, and the Pixel 4A. Right off the bat, I gave up on the Nord, since they aren’t sold in America. And between the A70 and Pixel 4a, I went with the Pixel mainly due to the 50$ less, and the fact that it has guaranteed 3 years of updates.

So, after a month(way too long to ship, by the way, but it won’t affect my review), the phone came in. It was super simple to set up, I just plugged my 6S into it and backed it up, and then switched my SIM into it. And then- the magic began.

Right off the bat it took me a bit of time to get adjusted to AndroidOS, but after a day or two, I was used to it. But after that… I started noticing the things that it does so much better then iOS. The always-on display, the app drawer, the notifications, and above all- the customization. I wondered why everyone wasn’t using this, the software was so much better! After a bit of thought and talking to my friend with the SE, I drew this conclusion-

iPhones are for people who aren’t into technology. If you just want a phone, and you want it to do what you need it to, and you don’t really care about price, then iPhone is the way to go. It works for people who aren’t into tech because its just… simple. Nothing fancy, nothing complicated, nothing ugly. Just… simple. But for them to be so simple, they have to take away some features, and they choose which ones to take away by predicting whether the average user uses that feature frequently. And while this isn’t a problem for people not into tech, those who are start to notice the missing features. And they start to want them back. So they switch to Android. Maybe a little more complicated, but they’re ok with it, because they get to have their customizations.

So when I got my 4a, I immediately took advantage of those customizations. I did everything I could to make the phone feel like… mine. With my iPhone, all I could do was change the wallpaper and shuffle my apps around on the home screen. With my Pixel, I could change the widgets, fonts, arrangement of apps, icon shape of apps, and so much more. It just felt more like MY phone instead of A phone. Now I could go into specifics of the Pixel itself, but it has some things that not all Android phones have.

So my final recommendation to Apple users considering switching to Android- would you be comfortable with learning how to use a phone over again? It might be weird for a day, a week, or even more- but the end result is so much better.


EDIT- I didn't mean that iPhone is bad, or that I dislike people who use them, I couldn't care less if you like Apple or not.

Android,"Hi Reddit,

I've seen a lot of interest here in the LG Wing, a quirky new smartphone with a display that swivels to reveal a smaller display underneath.

LG sent me the Wing yesterday and I've been playing around with it to find out if this form factor makes sense. If you have any questions about the Wing, I'll try to answer them as best I can.

Just keep in mind that LG sent reviewers including myself a pre-production unit, so we aren't allowed to do certain things like benchmarks or dive too deep into our experiences with the device. 


If you want to see the device in action, 
[my colleague Ben posted a hands-on of the Wing on XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-wing-preview/) and I also shared a few pics of it [on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1306614013489483783?s=19) I'll be putting my own thoughts together on the Wing after spending a bit more time to appreciate (or nitpick) its quirks.",Ask Me Questions about the LG Wing!,0.87,176,139,MishaalRahman

I would love some other qol options, like timed permissions (sure, have access to my GPS or microphone for half an hour while I'm using you then ask again next time), but it's just overall odd to me that they have permissions for some degree of security but many times only give the option of ""way more access to your phone than necessary or nothing at all"". I get that it simplifies things, but that's something of a weak argument because it's easy enough to have an ""east mode"" that functions just as the current setup does, and giving developers the tools and encouragement to localize their use of people's phones is only a good thing in my book.",Is there a reason Android doesn't have an option for better permission granularity?,0.79,56,50,FatCat0

Android,"As probably many of you, I have also wondered which of the two I should get.

So I ordered both and compared.

Right out of the gate the Redmi makes a better impression. It's thinner and slicker, feels more premium in your hand. It's actually surprising how 0.5mm in thickness makes such a big difference.
Don't get me wrong, the X3 is well built, for a budget phone, but it does feel chunky in comparison.
Redmi is a much bigger fingerprint magnet. I barely see anything on the back of the X3. It's probably due to the glossy finish of the 9 Pro since it has a Gorilla Glas 5 back and the X3 is just a simple plastic shroud.

**Performance:**

and that is a BIG surprise. The Poco X3 is SLOWER or the same, according to Geekbech5. I ran them side by side, a couple of times.
I've disabled all background apps and restarted both devices before running the tests.

The Redmi scored around 570 Single Core and 1770 Multicore, quite consistently.

The Poco X3 scored around 570 Single Core and 1700 Multicore, with the lowest score of 1530 for the Multicore.

I believe this is because the X3 seems to have worse cooling. But I'm not sure. The X3 does get hot when running those benchmarks while the Redmi was just a bit warm.

But it is staggering! The 732g is supposed to be quite a bit faster than the 720g in the Note 9 pro. Something is amiss here.

The CPU Identifier for the Redmi reads:

ARM implementer 81 architecture 8 variant 15 part 2052 revision 15

While the Poco reads:

ARM implementer 81 architecture 8 variant 13 part 2052 revision 14

So they do seem to be different CPUs, at least on paper.

.

The GPU Benchmarks are weird as well. They both have the same GPU, Adreno618, but the scores differ from software to software.

I used the Geekbech5 Compute Benchmark and the V1 GPU Benchmark Pro on the play store, as these two had the best review score.

Here's the interesting part: the Poco did NOT like the V1 benchmark. It scored terribly, much, much lower fps and scores compared to the Redmi.
We're talking 4100 vs 3000 points in the Village Benchmark at 1080p. Multiple runs, as always. And 3000 was not the lowest for the Poco, it really struggled in this benchmark.

The Geekbench5 Compute Benchmark showed a different story. Here the X3 scored a consistent 1300 points while the Redmi was around 1230. 3 Runs each.

I'm not sure what is wrong with the V1 benchmark and the Poco. Maybe it's the heat problem again? Since the Geekbench Compute Benchmark didn't really heat up either of the devices, but the V1 did, and considerably so.

**Screen:**

One of the very compelling arguments for buying the X3 is its 120Hz screen, a first for a phone in this price bracket.
But it's a difficult bet, in my opinion.

You can see the difference when running the UFO test. So if you're a mobile gamer and think you need high refresh rate - this might be it. But it is not very noticeable in day to day use. That's coming from someone who bought a 144hz monitor as soon as I could, couple of years ago.

The X3 does feel a bit more responsive and that might be due to its advertised 240Hz polling rate for the touch sensor.

What I don't like in the Poco is how it handles brightness. Maybe it's a bug, it is a new phone afterall, but at the lowest brightness, the app icons are still pretty bright. Brighter than the wallpaper by a bit. It seems like not much, but it did hurt my eyes a bit when I was playing with the phone at night.
The 9 pro seems to have a very consistent dimming of the screen.

Either way, there are 3rd party apps that dim your screen, so it should not be a dealbraker.

**Speakers:**

Here's where the Poco shines. The stereo speakers are great. They sound good, watching videos is fun, listening to music is nice and so much so that you don't always need a BT speaker. The phone gets pretty loud.

The speaker on the Note 9 Pro is just that. A speaker. Not terribly loud but enough for everything you might want to use your phone for.

The X3 is a clear winner here.

**Cameras:**

Nothing to write home about. They are pretty much the same. The wide angle has a higher resolution on the Poco(8v13mpx), and it's noticeable, but the Macro camera is worse(5vs2mpx).
Personally I think the ultra wide is far more important for day to day use, but I don't understand why you would limit your macro camera just to 2mpx, just don't include it if you want to cripple it by that much.
Quality is a bout the same on either of the main cameras, but overall due to the better wide angle I'd say the X3 wins here, even if it's just ever so slightly.

**Battery:**

Although the X3 has 160mAh more packed into its battery, it drains it faster, even at 60hz. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is a solid 2 day phone. The X3 will last you one day and a bit.
According to AccuBattery from play store, I get almost 14h of screen time on the Redmi and only 8,5h on the X3@120hz, that number jumps to around 10,5h@60hz.

Furthermore, I get way better ""mixed use"" stat. Meaning just normally using the phone. The Note 9 Pro gets 60+h of mixed use, while the X3 gets around 35h.

The Redmi wins here big.

**Various:**

What is worth mentioning is that the Redmi Note 9 Pro has a slot for 2 sim cards AND a microSD card, while the Poco fits either one sim and one SD, or two sim cards.
If you travel a lot and need two sim cards, the redmi is your phone then. Assuming you also need a microSD card.

**In conclusion...**

I think there are no clear winners, which is a shame. I think Xiaomi could've made a killer phone out of the X3. It has all the right specs on paper, but the execution is not always as good as one would expect and the performance numbers are very surprising, considering the all new Snapdragon 732g.
If a 120Hz screen and stereo speakers are a must for you and you're on a tight budget, then the Poco X3 is your only option.
Other than that I think the Redmi Note 9 Pro makes a better impression and FEELS better in the hand, which is not something to overlook. The X3 is a little brick, in comparison.
If you can wait, Xiaomi is supposedly about to release a Redmi Note 10 anytime soon, so maybe if you wait a month or two you can get the best of both worlds.",Poco X3 vs Redmi Note 9 Pro - is X3 a flop? A review,0.56,13,38,TahPenguin
Android,"I am not sure this is right place to discuss but I have a tought about recent epic vs apple/google battle over market cut. Seeing this lawsuit as an oppurtinity and see a better change is my wish.

As you know Apple sells devices and give them 5 year update for free. There is no any  android device manufacterer offering same service including google itself. Apple wants and can do that 'cause they are keep gainin money via market sales and service sales like icloud. That's why and how they can afford updating and service costs to older phones, tablets, computers, etc. 

There is no similar situation for android makers expect Google itself and they are very small player in this regard. I believe the key of changing this situtation is sharing some percent of market gain to device manufacturer. If you buy something on a device, then google should give them their share. Market cut won't be 30% but 15% and 3-5% of 15% will be going to device manufacturer. There are some reasons and benefits doing so and I will share them below. 

Reasons and benefits

1. %30 is too much. All cost is checking software whether it is working or safe and managing market, servers, bandwith etc. You don't need phisical warehouses, transportation costs unlike phisical stores. 30% is an older paradigm and should be changed. This way developers will gain more and user will spend less. Only loser is Apple/Google and it's still a good money. 
2. Yes, Google is owner and developer of android (despite it's an open source software) but phone makers don't simply download android and install it to phones like PC makers. They optimise OS, create suitable softwares and services for their hardware and this way they contribute Android platform. Most of Android feautures are created by device makers. Everyone would admit that Samsung did make Android a better OS in most way. For example; foldable phones are here and Android itself is not optimized for this; device makers make it possible. Then google will (or have done recently) add this feature to Android itself. We can't possible determine who contribute most and who will have X percentage but even making Adroid One devices means contribiting overall Android platform and deserve some part of it. Share percentage may be defined via some contract by device makers and Google and each of them deserve some part of tha gain. 
3. Device makers now only can earn money by only selling devices yet they simply have to keep their devices up to date and add features and doing this costs money. But on the other hand Apple and Google keep profiting by selling software on markets and selling services and this is not possible for device makers. Samsung tries some but we can't compare their market share since it's very small in comparision (their markets and services I mean). But updating devices requires resources and this can only be accomplished by having some part of market and service gain. %3-5 share would be enough for this and only this way any phone maker can support 4-5 years of update warranty.
4. Since only way of earning more money for device makers, making as much as garbage devices and fill the market with them and then forgeting about them after a short while. Having some google play share now device makers will have a continious gain over their devices and they will have a good reason to up to date their devices. They will benefit of their devices' longer lifespan. That means less garbage device with better hardware and maybe with better prices. Less hardware resources leads a better environtment and less money spent by costumers. 
5. Since market will have less kind and mostly updated devices, developers can optimize their software better and easer and consider/support older hardwares (lower tier CPUs, lower RAM etc). This means overall better user experience, beter development process and better environtment.",And offer to revision to 30% market (GooglePlay) cut and sharing it with Hardware Manufacturers,0.37,0,15,simbolmina

""Android device makers, like Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones.

Fast forward to today and things are starting to feel very different. We have the new apple watch that was announced yesterday which is looking better and better. Hugely customizable and just a very cool looking device. The only problem is, you need an iPhone to own one. Fortunately the parity between phones is almost identical these days. Most popular apps are on both. Each allow you a good level of customization now. Ios 14 added home screen widgets for instance.

Where's the great Pixel Watch?  Even out of the gate I can't imagine it doing an 8th of what the apple watch does because they've been iterating on it for years. The Wear OS on the other hand is just barely not abandonware. 

Then you have all the excellent apple services popping up.. Apple+ for tv, fitness+ for connected exercise videos and such.. instant updates on the OS releases, and oh yeah, that bad ass looking watch. Seems to be a super attractive space to move in to.

Note that every single sensor, including the proximity/light sensor, will be disabled, so keep that in mind before making calls or if you go into a bright or dark place. Simply disable Sensors Off again via the toggle to set everything back to normal.

To enable it, you'll need Android 10. Some OEMs may have removed/disabled it, so your milage may vary. It is avaliable on Samsung devices and OnePlus devices. I assume it's also available on Pixel devices.

Android,"I would like to open a discussion about your experience regarding any type of UI lag or strange slowdowns on your phone.

Let me make it clear, that this does not include slower loading times for various applications because of lower-spec hardware. I am only talking about issues that have either appeared a while after using your phone (so not there from the start) or they have been there from the start but are disruptive enough for day-to-day use that you think they should be included here.

I will also give some examples from my personal experience which actually made me create this post:

 - on my Galaxy Note 8: I am having some random issues with general UI lag. For example: when unlocking the phone, starting applications and using applications, the phone sometimes drops some serious frames which makes the experience ""choppy"" or ""stuttery"", for lack of better terms. This doesn't happen all the time, but it's become more and more noticeable as time passed.

 - also on my Galaxy Note 8: extreme delay in opening apps. It's not related to a specific app, but sometimes (again, not always) when I try to open an app (banking app, Google maps, etc) the app simply doesn't open right away. Sometimes it's not an app per se, but the keyboard inside the app that takes eons to load (Gboard). I try to open it again and 5 to 20 seconds later all the actions I have previously tried start happening in quick succession, like the phone just got past a roadblock and is just now processing all my inputs. The app pops up, the keyboard shows up and disappears, it's generally a huge mess and it settles down after a few seconds and everything is usable again.

 - on my Exynos S20+ 4G: my S20+ is definitely much smoother than the Note 8, but it sometimes has the same problems, albeit at a much lower scale: stutters when opening applications, delays when opening keyboard (1-3 seconds), delays when opening an app (just the other day I tried opening Reddit Boost and it took 10 seconds for it to load).

I would like to figure out from this post the following:

 - if you're also experiencing such issues
 - if issues of such severity are limited to Samsung or specifically to Exynos, or are normal on a wide range of devices and operating systems. I experienced such issues on my iPhone 11 Pro Max, but with much lower intensity.
 - if after experiencing such issues you have found a solution on how to ameliorate or even eliminate them.

Android,"I have been helping several of my relative with tech support over the years. Over the years, my family has become geographically disperse, so I can no longer drop by to fix something in person. Fortunately, technology has made it possible to do tech support over the web. I thought I share my experience.

**Degree of interaction**

Sharing comes in different levels, the two level I see is:

1. You can see the remote screen, but can’t make changes.
2. You can see and interact with the remote screen, but only with the remote user’s approval.
3. You can see and interact with the remote screen unattended.

If the person is knowledgeable, I favor option #1, because you are making the other user do the work, this often result in them learning how to do it themselves. For really non-technical users, the ones that may have difficulty just turning on the computer, option #3 is the way to go. However, you may be limited to what the system permits.

**Remoting Software**

The following are software that I have used. There are probably more that are not listed. That does not mean they don’t work, but that I haven’t tried them.

Chrome Remote Desktop

Teamviewer

AnyDesk

AweSun

Chrome Remote Desktop – Supports remote access of Windows, linux, macOS and chromeOS from Android, iOS, chromeOS, linux, and Windows. Access is within the browser.

Teanviewer – support remote access of Windows, MacOS, Android, and Linux from windows, MacOS, Android, and linux. In my opinion, cross platform-wise, teamviewer is probably the most comprehensive, it’s the only product that can remote to older Android phones.

For Android phones, Teamview must have a plug-in for or you can’t remote control it. You can look up what brand is supported.

Team mobile offers a product call Teamviewer Host that allow you to have unattended access. In practice, this doesn’t really work all that well. The host typically shutdown after the screen goes out even if you turn off eco-mode and make sure that host is protected.

Another issue is that Teamviewer has increase their push to get people to sign up. This mean you may get flagged as commercial usage, which reduces your session to 5 minutes.  You can email them to get it removed, but it may take a week. From what I can determine, accessing Teamviewer from more than a single computer will result in “commerical usage” detected. In addition, I also found the recent software to be really unstable.

AnyDesk – support remote access of Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and FreeBSD to  Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and FreeBSD. Supposedly started by former employees of Teamviewer. The interface is very similar.

Like Teamviewer, it will support remoting to phones. For Android phone, you must have Android 5 or later to share screen and Andorid 7 or later for interaction. Like teamviewer, the interactive part requires a plug-in to be installed.

Awesun – Similar to Anydesk ,but supports windows, macos, ios, and android but apparently not linux. Seems to be a very similar product to Anydesk and have roughly the same requirements.

**Remote Recommendation by Platform**

The following is my observation of accessing the different platform. You may wonder why I don’t have IOS or Mac. This is because none of my relative use the two platforms.

Windows

My preference is to use Chrome Remote Desktop. It works pretty well and you can actually set it up to connect unattended. AnyDesk and Teamviewer will work, too.

ChromeOS

You are pretty much stuck with Chrome Remote Desktop and you cannot setup the chrome os to connect unattended. To connect, the person must send you a one-time remote code. Using Chrome Remote Desktop to access ChromeOS is not ideal. ChromeOS looks like the chrome browser so you are displaying ChromeOS inside your chrome browser, so it can be confusing because you have 2 layers of tabs.

Android

My preference currently is to use AnyDesk. Chrome remote desktop doesn’t work with accessing Android. Teamviewer has a bad habit of disconnecting or have false-positive that you are using it commercially. Another reason is that unattended access actually works most of the time.

However, if you have a phone that is older than Android 7, you have to use Teamviewer and you can only use it if there is a compatible plugin.

Linux

I don’t have anyone who uses Linux, but I imagine Anydesk will work.

**Security**

Using any remote product will increase your security risk. Accessibility and security is a balancing act. I wouldn’t have my relatives install remoting software if they didn’t need my help. Make sure all host are protected by a really secure password. I also warn the user that they should not accept request for connection unless they come from me.

I also know nothing about the secuciry of the different vendors. I don’t know how secure they are and what information they may be collecting. In the case of Google, I am pretty sure they will try to make sure Chrome remote desktop is secure since it impacts their credibility. I have very little info on Anydesk or Awesun.

Just to be on the safe side, I typically run remote access through a VM running linux and the linux box has only external access to the internet. No use burning myself helping others.

**UPDATE**

I take back what I said about AnyDesk. While implement-wise it seems faster than Teamviewer, it's got a bunch of issues.

* On Android, there are instances when the screen blanks out. I am not sure why, but I think it may actually be a feature because it blanks out on certain things that you may want to blank out. For example if you remote to your android and then pull up a site for Charles Schwab, Mint, or last pass, the screen goes blank. The problem with this is that this limits its use as a tech support tool.
* On android, I have had situations where any desk can connect to the machine but the screen is blank. It may be related to the previously mentioned blanking.
* On android, there is no navigation buttons on the bottom like in Teamviewer, so for example, I can't go home. The workaround is to use the hotkeys like CTRL-ALT-Shift+Home to go home.

I also notice that Teamviewer has fixed a previous issue which is session dropping after inacctivity. It still does that, but when you reconnect, it will wake up the session now. So Teamviewer may still be the only way to go if you want Android remote.

Click run at the bottom right of the screen and put you finger on the sensor. For me a exclamation mark came up but then it exited out of the test real quick. You have to click the exclamation mark very very quickly to see the fingerprint picture and before it goes away.

Android,"The ZTE z2332cc is an interesting device. It's a Consumer Cellular branded phone (a cell phone carrier that targets primarily older people) that runs Android, but can hardly be considered a smartphone, as it has no app marketplace at all, no web browser, and no touch screen. 

[Single image](https://i.imgur.com/53X3IGl.png)  
[Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/ewfU7R5)  

The features it include are text messaging, camera, FM radio, calls, image gallery, clock (timer, alarm), contacts, media player, calendar, calculator, settings, and file manager.

I was setting up this new flip phone for my grandma and was very surprised to find that it actually runs Android. However, even though Android is what powers it, there's no Google Play Store or even a browser (though kind of makes sense since there's no touch screen to interact with it.) It does have a file manager and SD card slot, so maybe it's possible that you could side load APKs to it, though I can't imagine my 91 year old non-tech-savvy grandma would like that. However, aside from the fact there's no touch screen (which would make it very hard to interact with the majority of apps), I believe it could run into issues as I suspect they have taken out several parts of Android.

I was shocked, as last time I had a basic feature phone (non-smartphone) back in 2012, they all had their own proprietary OSs. I wouldn't have expected this switch, as while Android is a great OS for smartphones, I'd have thought it would be unnecessarily heavy for a basic feature phone (making it need a more powerful processor, more RAM, and a larger battery than otherwise necessary.) However, the box said this uses a Qualcomm processor (didn't specify which), so my guess is that with economies of scale, it is cheaper to just use a low-end Qualcomm processor than manufacture a custom low-end SoC for a phone that caters to a very small audience. With it using a Qualcomm processor, they probably thought it'd be cheaper to just use Android versus build their own proprietary OS for a phone that likely doesn't sell much.

Still, I was surprised they barely even changed the default AOSP look even if it ran Android underneath. But I guess they know their target audience doesn't care about a custom UI. 

Though it may look like they just loaded AOSP onto it and added buttons to interact with the UI, I think they removed several components of Android, as it has very good battery life so far in my limited testing. 

One last thing I found interesting, this may be the first phone I have ever seen that supports 4G LTE, but has no WIFI or browser.",Even some basic feature flip-phones with no touch screen now use Android underneath,0.94,525,69,j0hnl33

Android,"IFTTT has moved to a monthly subscription model. They are restricting the basic free accounts to a maximum of 3 custom applets.

The pricing is $9.99 per month, but until october they are offering pay what you want pricing (from $1.99) which will work for the first year only.

As of right now they are not removing any applets you have created over the 3 applet limit on a free account, and these applets seem to be working still. But no telling how long that lasts.

This is really sad news for me, I had a few applets set up, and have used IFTTT for a long time. I had always been keen for a pro model which allowed for additional features, but never thought it would be this much, and didn't think they'd lock the existing features behind a paywall as well.

Android,"Hi , I was thinking about one thing when looking on this sub and one thing struck me like a truck : nothing really justifies buying a new phone other than the desire for change or pleasuring yourself (well not like that weirdo , hear me out ). Before you changed phones because the new one was so powerful that it made your previous phone look like garbage. 
When the Galaxy s2 got out , it creamed everything existing so hard on power and video decoding that it was outrageous, the s3 ? Even perfected that , it even had LTE for the first time and TWO WHOLE GIGS OF RAM OH MY LORD. And that was it , in two years only your galaxy s1 was not even useful as a paperweight compared to what was available at that time.

Now look at us , look at a phone that is two or even three years old , what did we gain ? 
Yeah slightly bigger screens , slightly smaller bezels , ever so slightly better cameras. Look at the pixel 4a , it uses the same sensor as the old Pixel 2 and yet , compare it to the top notch Note 20 ultra and tell me : are you able to objectively tell me ""yeah this is so much worse"" without pixel peeping ? Hell even when I'm actually zoomed all the way in I can't tell sometimes. And that is 3 year old hardware! 

Oh and well we had our fair bit of regressions also in the meantime:
- losing the headphone jack
- notches and holes in the screen (tbh I like these but I'd understand why people would not) 
- slower , less reliable under display fingerprint sensors
- the near death of expandable storage
- 1K+ Prices
- curved displays without having the choice (granted these already existed in the s6 era but at least you had the choice)
- locked to the bone bootloaders and nothing to do what you want with your own expensive mini computers (which now even cost more than one...) 

Yeah it's all pretty ... Plain , I don't even feel excited anymore on this subreddit I feel like everything is all just editorial and paid youtubers ""CHECK OUT THIS NEW PHONE ZOMG "" ( I hated every second here the flooding of everything by the unexceptional Oneplus Nord).

However I talked at the beginning about the fact of making yourself a little pleasure , a little gift with a new phone and I respect that , we all need something new from time to time and who am I to tell you what to do with your hard earned money ? To hell with that , do whatever you want king ! I get that you find that you want to try that new high refresh rate display , that sweet oled or even the 50X zoom. 

For my part I settled on my Poco F1 and everything looks pretty fine , yes it has that ugly ass notch but I can hide it , the camera is good enough for me , the 4000mah makes it a runner , the snap845 remains still above (ever so slightly) of a good midranger like the 760G, the display is IPS but color accurate and bright , I can live with a 64g model as long as I can get my photos/music/films on an sd card. And that's what pains me the most : nothing makes me go wow , even after 2 years , nothing that would be an undiscutable replacement for that phone.",Nothing justifies a phone change anymore,0.84,402,260,azorsenpai

Android,"Hey you guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Got a new S10 for under 500 Euro (588,39 Non-Euro but Dollar) and I am impressed so far, its a huge step up from my S6. Anyways I am big into Smart Home, so I thought maybe I can use this to keep my Smartphone Battery happy and healthy (don't over or undercharge it while unsupervised).

&amp;#x200B;

I know Lithium-Ion is already made to not charge fully and so on but please refrain from doing this discussion in the comments all over again...

&amp;#x200B;

So what do u need:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A fitting charger with the right Output for your Phone
2. A working and save Charging cable (I recommend  a magnetic one to also increase the lifespan of the charging-port)
3. Just any TP-Link, Kasa Smart Home Plug (HS100/  KP105...) for 15-20 Euro
4. The IFTT App (free)
5. The Tasker App (4 Euro) or just any App that can notify you of your Phone reaching a certain Percentage in Battery charge via a Notification in the Status-Bar like 'Trigger'
6. ((Bixby optional))

&amp;#x200B;

Bixby can help to avoid some steps, might be able to do this without any other App in the Future...

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the Idea? 

First, the Phone goes below 30 or 20 Percent in Battery Charge.  This Triggers Tasker or your App of choice to display a fitting Notification and this in turn triggers the IFTT App to Turn on or off the Kasa Plug with your Charger in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Bixby at this Point can activate the Plug via the Smart Things App and **without a Hub** when dropping below a certain Percentage in Betterycharge but it can't Trigger Events when above a certain Battery charge, which is truly a missed opportunity...

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it, please write in the comments if you need help or have ideas to improve the cost or processes. Once this all works, it can really take the pressure off the Battery!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: All these Apps might be killed by the Battery management of your Phone so please exclude them from Optimization via the Settings. If you want to keep track of your Battery Health, I recommend the 'AccuBattery' App but there might be better options, if so, please feel free to write them in the comments...","Automate Charging, keep Battery between 20% and 80% to increase Lifespan with Kasa Smart Home Plug, IFTT App, and Tasker",0.6,11,16,Antilazuli

Android,"I've just finished building a small tool called [symbit](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit) which helps with rooting and updating of existing rooted devices. With Android 10, some TWRP versions have not been updated to support the new /system partition format and do not work for those devices. This tool aims to solve the issue by making it easier to root and update existing rooted Android devices.

[Source code](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit)

[README](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/blob/master/README.md)

[Download Links](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit#install)

My original motivation to create this was when my friend asked me for help updating his Pixel 3 XL. Due to the fact that TWRP does not support Android 10 on the Pixel, I had to tell him to use the manual updating method which involved typing many commands to update the system and patching the boot.img file via Magisk. I decided then to create this small utility to help him and (hopefully) someone else who may have difficulties rooting/updating their rooted device.

In future when I (hopefully) have more time to work on this, it will support running without a PC and directly on Android itself through termux.

Android,"At some point several months ago both my and my wife's phone stopped being able to connect to Google Messages for Web. Every time we scanned the QR code to connect it would fail to do so and throw a non-specific error. Googling the problem didn't reveal many answers as most posts are from 2018-2019 and people have success in re-connecting by simply clearing app data/cache, which didn't work for us. 

What did work today was changing the IPv6 DNS server address on our router to a Google DNS server address. It seems that the default DNS server would time-out and fail to resolve the request for some reason. (We moved a few months ago and have a new ISP, presumably the DNS server we connected to changed at that time). 

Hope this helps anyone who has been having a similar problem. PS this may also help if you have trouble connecting your PC to the Microsoft Your Phone Companion app or similar applications.","If your phone can't connect to Messages for Web, try changing your DNS server",0.88,116,23,azurile57

Android,"I do not think it is catastrophically bad but it is definitely something that I dislike and in a way a very anti-competitive move from Samsung, and to fight that the only two options are either some huge regulatory pressure OR maybe we can still use some old free-market pressure and pick something else? It looks like already [Samsung is not doing well this year](https://9to5google.com/2020/09/02/samsung-all-but-drops-off-of-the-top-10-best-selling-smartphones-in-first-half-of-2020/) and maybe some extra pressure from buyers would send some message? In some instance we might already be at a point where there is very little choice (for instance with the phones specifically sold by carriers) but other than that what are the good options?

Here is a short list, please feel free to suggest any good alternative!

1) Buy Samsung with Snapdragon from somewhere else - IMHO a bad idea for warranty and to some extent updates, maybe even price but most important very bad for market pressure purpose - if instead of Exynos Samsung we buy Snapdragon Samsung we have sent a pretty bad message and Samsung will laugh at us all the way to the bank. That IMHO is an especially bad example to be set with the Fold 2 but that is another story.

2) Sony Xperia 1 II (and soon Sony Xperia 5 II) - IMHO those are at the very top for somebody that values the headphone jack (and Sony must be commended for listening to the customers on that issue) but unfortunately availability worldwide in general and in Europe in special seems abysmal.

3) Asus Zenfone 7 Pro - just as above availability worldwide in general and in Europe in special seems abysmal.

4) Oneplus 8T/8T Pro - remains to be seen what those will bring, 8 Pro did not impress me personally but Oneplus is the ONLY phone from the entire BBK group (Oneplus, Oppo, Vivo, Realme) that I would somehow consider buying from the software point of view.

5) Xiaomi phones - the Mi 10 Ultra seems interesting but will be China-only and in fact very, very few of the best Xiaomi phones have decent international availability and support - this could improve a little when many carriers seem to move from Huawei to Xiaomi but I would not hold my breath (and generally software updates for Xiaomi are still poor and not something I would recommend for a flagship).

What other options do you think there are in Europe?

EDIT:

I appreciate the idea of a midrange phone but the title of the post was very clear, if your answer is that you probably did not read anything I wrote or you are trolling. Also the naive suggestion of ""buy a midrange"" is in Europe again a significant issue and it again leaves the monopolists like Samsung run laughing at us all the way to the bank.",Android flagship alternatives in Europe to the Samsung Exynos 990 fiasco?,0.77,110,126,catalinus

Android,"A week ago, I published a controversial post in which I claim that most of the answers to the question of whether it is possible to connect cheap phones to a TV using an HDMI cable are incorrect. Read the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/iizk47/most_answers_here_about_hdmi_support_is_wrong/).

Since several of you said I was wrong, I promised to make a video about it. So I ordered a suitable hdmi adapter, and a cheap Oppo A5 2020 phone.

Why this phone? Firstly, because it is cheap and only has a USB 2.0 port, and secondly, because you can read on the OPPO support page that [it does not support](https://oppo.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13064/~/do-oppo-phones-support-connecting-phone-to-tv-with-an-hdmi-cable-or-adapter%3F) direct connection with an HDMI cable.

I mean, just Imagine what could be done with Samsung hardware and polishing, and googles smarts and resources. Apple could have a real competitor. Instead they fight and slowly, Apple advances further. They used to be ahead of Apple in almost every category. Now, they’re almost behind in all of them. Apple just grows, while innovation between Samsung and google stops. I don’t think any of the other phones matter right now. Lg is hopelessly behind in brand image, huawai is pretty much dead in the us, and any other manufacturer that’s not Chinese or these companies doesn’t have the resources to really capture more of the market. Just to top it off, the losses for the loosing company are immense. 

If Samsung wins:

- Google could lose up to 60% of its market share. This could decimate Android. 
- This could also be the end of Samsung, as unless they can make something in house that’s good, this could be a repeat of bada os. 

If google wins: 

- Samsung would lose it’s os. Let’s face it, bada os failed. They’re just not good at wowing devs and consumers. 
- Googles android division could be dead, as 60% of android phones could become something else.

&amp;#x200B;

Bought two pairs (black &amp; white) for my S.O. and myself, directly from Google, they took about a week to get here. We were both super excited since we are both pixel phone owners.

Then we were hit with the audio skipping issue at exactly 1 min 50 seconds. Nothing would fix it, not factory resetting or bluetooth cache deleting or left bud first, etc.

Called Google for a refund and they didn't even push an exchange, they just said ""yeah ok so I can process the refund for you"".

It's kind of disappointing that this is such a wide-spread issue (a LOT of threads on reddit and other sites show this) with a product that costs so much. I've had much better/stable connection with 20-30 dollar buds.

If anyone has a good working pair then yeah stick to them but otherwise beware of the 1:50 issue, it isn't fixable every time.

Android,"Thought I'd get this post gong as I've just gotten a new phone and moved away from my two year long nightmare phone. It was a Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium and though on paper it was a decent phone in real life it was god awful.

I had previously owned a Sony Xperia Z3 from 2015 to 2016 before moving to a Galaxy S7 up until late 2018. I will shoulder some of the blame as I decided I'd wanted to use a big phone but my god was that a mistake, which is why I got the XZ2P. That thing was a massive chonky boi. One handed use was impossible. Using my phone lying down caused massive arm cramps and with almost a quarter kg of phone I'm sure I gave myself a concussion every time I dropped it on my face.

The size was a big part of the unusability for me but the user was experience and software was what really made it horrendous. Two years and three android versions later there was still no gesture navigation (which probably would have made using the phone easier) or face unlock, and I only just got system wide dark mode in April. The software was essentially stock android packed with Sony bloat with very little added in the way of user experience. I was baffled coming from my S7 as why screenshots didn't immediately allow for cropping or to go into scrolling capture mode? Why was there no screen recording, a feature that was on Z3 3 years earlier? Network interaction with my sim card was horrendous as well as after ages talking to multiple customer service places I found out that the thickness of the phone affected signal quality indoors and with no WiFi calling it meant people would try to call me and get a dead line alot. Horrendous app optimisation was also infuriating. There was a one in 5 chance that playing a song on Spotify would cause my phone to freeze for 5 mins then restart and plenty of games that should have been light work for the phones SD845 processor would run like utter shit because it clearly wasn't made with game performance in mind.

Android,"So I wanted to setup this post to have as sort of a discussion and gather others opinions on the potential (and most likely) Pixel 5 from google. I also wanted to state that I am currently using a Pixel 4 myself (and wanted to discuss my disappointments.)

&amp;#x200B;

Since the release of the pixel they have had 2 defining features. The stock Android experience, and arguably the best camera upon release each generation. They have never toted the best specs, and sometimes even left out some newer hardware, but the camera gave it a reason to be used. Now with leaks surrounding the Pixel 5 it looks like they will be downgrading the specs, and rather than at least having flagship level processors it is obvious that they are moving away from that. Leaks also highly speculate at a plastic back, a back mounted finger print scanner (I personally grew to like face unlock, but am disappointed in not at least having an in screen!), and with these being out of the picture I would not be surprised at a lack of wireless charging. These all seem like a MASSIVE downgrade from the past products offered. However, none of this stacks up to the letdown that the cameras will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Rumors are agreeing that they will stay with the same camera hardware that they have been using since the Pixel 2, a massive disappointment. With what Google has achieved through software imagine the insane potential they have if they now upgraded the hardware and paired it with the software! On top of this, by downgrading the processor there is no way that the software can work it's magic as well as the pixel 4, and with the pixel 4 having guaranteed updates for 2 more years it should outperform. In addition to this supposedly they will take away the telephoto lens, and replace it with an ultra wide. I am all for an ultra wide, but it is time that google has a triple camera setup and ADDS the ultra wide, not replace the telephoto with it. With all the camera rumors coming around it seems like one of the only 2 reasons to buy a Pixel device, and arguably the biggest reason, is now dead.

&amp;#x200B;

If these current rumors turn to be true upon release I will personally not be getting a new device from Google. I am honestly fine with a mid range processor, but the letdown of a premium design and hardware, as well as the catastrophic letdown of the cameras lead there to be little reason to desire a Pixel device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely want to have a discussion to see what peoples opinions are if the Pixel 5 matches these rumors. What do you think makes it a considerable device, what are you personally disappointed in, and current Pixel 4 owners would you consider upgrading - (downgrading?) - ?","With rumors surrounding an upcoming Pixel 5, what is there actually in the device to actually entice a purchase over any other phone?",0.56,6,34,PalmTreeExpert

Android,"Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, deliberately lowers quality of uploads for Android users, compression happens on the server side, so there is no excuse, also they are using the same version of libx264, so again no excuse.

Does Apple pays Instagram to do this? Is this legal?

Why Does smartphone reviewers like /u/Marques-Brownlee , /u/ThisIsTechToday , UnboxTherapy never talk about this?

If is not illegal and it is not a disloyal, unfair action, why Google doesn't do the same for YouTube? Like deliberately lowers the quality of whatever it is uploaded from an iPhone or any other Apple product?

Here is a link of an article written in spanish that made some tests to prove what I’m saying.

[https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion](https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion)

Basically, doesn't matter what you use to shoot a video, even if you use a Red Camera, or a Canon DSLR, even if you shoot your videos on an iPhone! if you upload that video using an Android it will look like garbage, if you upload exactly the same video using iPhone it will look crystal clear.

Tik Tok for example doesn't do this, and the overall quality of the app looks a lot much better than Instagram because of the same reason, Android and Apple users can upload crystal clear videos if they have a good camera.

Why nobody is complaining? I love pixel phones, and I love the camera picture style, but there is no sense on having this quality if I can not share it with anyone.

If this was fixed a lot of people, influencers, and creatives will be able to switch to Android.

“Happiness is only real, when shared""

EDIT: 
Please be aware that I'm not talking about recording video with the integrated camera app, I understand all the hardware variations that this involves and how hard it can be to achieve homogeneous results. I'm talking about uploading a video recorded with another app or device, using the app only as an uploader, shouldn't produce different results as the compression happens server side using the same version of x264 library.

EDIT2:
Someone suggested to use Instander, an instagram mod which can manipulate some flags inside the app, one of this flags is able to override the video upload quality bitrate, I try this with the suggested value of 10mb, and it really worked, the uploaded result looks a lot more sharper https://imgur.com/a/vya4QKs I will try a higher bitrate to see how hi can I go up, this also proves that it is just a setting and not a hardware variation in smartphones what is causing this as a lot of people suggest. I understand some phones might struggle with higher bitrates, but instagram could at least try higher values for latest processor chips, and not just put one low setting for everybody.

Another tool that yield interesting results was Inssist a chrome instagram client extension, you can upload stories and videos directly from your computer, however I found that this videos had to be carefully crafted, with a bitrate not very high so instagram don't compress them a lot, and not so low so they don't look ugly, in my tests using ffmpeg to encode the videos before uploading with a CRF of 20 or a 12mb VBR(6457k) yield very good results depending on the duration and darkness of the videos.","Happiness is only real, when shared.

Android,"Typical question is like: does my phone supports HDMI cable connection? Is there a way / adapter which allows to connect my phone to TV using a HDMI cable?

And the typical answer is: no. Your phone doesn't have USB 3.1, just USB 2.0, so you have to use only the Chromecast (wireless) adapter.

Especially the Xiaomi community here is full of these wrong answers, as most of Xiaomi phones does have the USB 2.0 interface only.

But the truth is: ALMOST ALL Android devices, phones or tablets, is possible to connect to TV through a HDMI cable. Just with another kind of adapter...

To be more specific: if your phone / tablet

1. runs Android 5 (Lollipop) or newer,
2. does have the USB 2.0 interface - no matter the connector, Micro USB or USB-C,
3. and supports the OTG,

then there is almost 100% probability you can connect your phone to TV using the particular HDMI adapter and HDMI cable, and Chromecast is definitely not your only option.

So, as these three requirements meets almost all phones and tablets sold nowadays, most answers here is simply wrong. Or ... not fully correct, at least.

EDIT: DisplayLink is the name of this another solution. But there is a catch. And unfortunately, not the only one. So I started working on a complete video how-to. In which I demonstrate, explain and test this solution. I will use three different phones:

1. Cheap Xiaomi Redmi 9A with Micro USB port. Mainly because I found a opinion in a comments that you have no possibility to connect a phone with Micro USB port to HDMI. Ok, let's see.
2. Mid class Redmi Note 9 Pro. Just because it is a typical, popular model, with good price / performance ratio.
3. And the top model Pocophone Poco F2 Pro 8GB (LPDDR5) RAM.

I will test these phones with two different HDMI adapters, based on two different chipsets. And I will test every combination at least with YouTube, Netflix, and Call of Duty Mobile. I think it will address most of questions around the Android phones and HDMI cable connection possibility / functionality...

PS: Yes, I know you read on internet that Neflix doesn't work through DisplayLink. But I say that's not true either. There is a way also for Netflix.

PPS: So, as I read the comments, I clearly can't emhasise enough the fact I'm talking just about A WAY.

ChromeCast is one of that ways. ChromeCast is a wireless adapter which allows to mirror your phone screen to TV. This (wireless) way / adapter comes with own pros and cons. One of pros is that it is wireless. One of cons is that it is ... wireless; so it needs wireless router to connect to, and the picture does have so big delay, that it is unusable to play the games with.

As another solution you can consider the DisplayLink adapter. It also comes with it's own pros and cons. Cons can be, for example, that it is a bit pricey (very subjective), or the picture resolution is limited up to FullHD - 1920x1080 pixels. Or that this is not a native solution. I know.

All I say that this is just another solution and that it is not very well known solution. But works. With it's own limitations, but works too.

And finally, all I wants to do for you, is to test this solution and make a video in which you find answers to your (repeating) questions: what is the picture quality? What's the delay? What about tearing?","Most answers here, about HDMI support, is wrong.",0.47,0,103,web-developer-ba

Android,"I had both devices and im not gonna get into which phone is better overall that is a post of its own but I will compare their cameras. 

I noticed that iPhone has easier camera app to uss but also much more limited. Here is my comparison. 


Main Camera-iPhone takes more realistic colors but on the other hand P30 Pro captures more detail in certain conditions. It comes down to personal preference if you like realistic colors on iPhone or the ones on Huawei better.iPhone handles artifacts better aswell but P30 Pro has better autofocus. I give slight edge to iPhone in this one

Telephoto Camera-Huawei is clear winner here. It has unreal capabilities and despite being released year and a half ago its still great in that department not only holding up to but beating some of the 2020 flagships. It offers amazing 5x optical zoom and 10x hybrid aswell as 50x digital compared to Apples 2x optical and 10 digital. Agaim, clear winner is Huawei P30 Pro. 


Ultrawide-iPhone has better colors and bigger field of view but there is more noise and some deformation at the edges. On the other hand Huawei P30 Pro has good exposure good detail tho unnatural detail rendering appears in some shots and it can be inconsistent with colors it generally captures more detail and has less noise. I would call this one a draw but if i had to choose winner i think slight edge goes to iPhone 11 Pro Max because of wider field of view. 


Portrait/Bokeh-Okay this is where I think iPhone is terrible despite ""reviews"" including even the mighty DxOmark giving it a fairly good grades. Whenever I tried to take portrait shot on iPhone, it came out terrible compared to Huawei P30 Pro. Inside of between my arm and torso is never blured so If i want to avoid that I had to pin my arms to my body or not take portrait shot but a regular one. It also struggles around edges especially on hair. On the other hand only thing you can complain about on P30 Pro is somewhat unnatural skin tone. Other than that amazing edges and ovarall much better shots than iPhone including detail on my clothes alot of times. Winner is clearly Huawei P30 Pro. 


Night-Another overrated aspect of iPhones camera. If you want to take quick photo in dark of someone or something you can't. It needs night mode to take photos in dark while Huawei P30 Pro does just good even with night mode off using auto mode. However when we do turn on night mode, again iPhone produces more realistic colors but Huawei captures more detail. If we go darker than well lit situation with street lights and stuff iPhone performs terribly while Huawei maintains alot of detail and brightens up the photo somehow. Also if you want to zoom in on iPhone you don't use telephoto camera instead it crops and uses digital zoom, thats why you can't zoom out to use ultrawide with night mode on. You can do that on Huawei P30 Pro. This one goes to Huawei too, by a considerable margin. 


Video-iPhone produces better colors generally with better stabilisation.It can also record in 60 fps at 4k while P30 can't go past 30fps.iPhone wins this one, tho video with ultrawide imo is better on P30 Pro. Still iPhone 11 Pro Max wins comftorably. 


Extra modes and features
iPhone 11 Pro Max really lacks alot conpared to Huawei P30 Pro and thats a huge minus in this comparison aswell and something that really sets P30 Pro apart. Here are all the great modes/features iPhone lacks compared to Huawei:
Macro Mode
Aperture Mode
Master AI
Pro Mode
Underwater Mode
RAW Format


All of these are useful things to have that iPhone decided to ignore. Also none of these are rated on DxOmark... Some phones have whole lens dedicated to macro shots and DxOmark ignores it. There is alot of things DxOmark doesn't analize that it should and I think their grades shouldn't be taken too seriously because even their grades are off quite often and have alot of unrealistic grades. 


So anyways that is what I noticed from my exoerience. I think Huawei P30 Pro wins this one tho for some users it doesn't matter because they only use main camera and portrait and front camera which is something both phones do grest job of like pretty much 98% of flagships since 2019 out there and to those people small things and details won't really matter so its a thing of ppreference.

Android,"Back on the old days, where people really want to get rid of Samsung's Lagwhiz because of horrible optimization. It was unstable, has a bunch of bloatwares and skin heavy. Other people also wanted more features and customizations.  
The very popular custom ROM named ""CyanogenMod"" offered more stability and regular updates(there were other good roms too). It was not perfect, but it has less bugs compared to stock.

But fast forward on 2017 and beyond. The flashing community became less.  
Some people believe that flashing a custom ROM is not anymore necessary, because stock ROM is already good enough for a daily driver. Hardware is getting more battery efficient and powerful too.  


I have some friends back on my college that no longer flashes custom ROM. They were flashaholics and flash ROMs during classes.  
They said its good enough and they don't want further customizations/features.  


I got a Redmi K20 Pro last year. For almost a year, I have remained on stock MIUI.  
Even if I was a custom ROM addict before, for sometime, I forgot that custom ROMs exist for almost a year, because stock was enough and sufficient for my daily needs.  


Until a month ago, I wanted to bring back nostalgic memories of my past. When I was still using a Galaxy S4, flashing custom ROMs everyday.  


So I browsed XDA forums to flash a ROM, and found out that there is still a lot of people into this type of stuff. I got bored of MIUI so i wanted to try another thing.

Android,"So this may be an unpopular opinion, but if you are like me and want to keep your phones for many years, get a phone with an IPS screen. The majority of OLED screens will start getting burn in after about 2 years (even if you are conscious about them and take special care of them, which is a pain in the ass). Most phones' warranties end after 2 years so your only option will be to replace it and OLED screens are very expensive, so replacing your phone will make more sense then. An IPS screen is better than an OLED with burn in 3 or 4 years down the line, and even if you happen to damage it, you can replace it on the cheap.","If you keep your phones for 2+ years, don't get an OLED screen.",0.28,0,42,thatsgonnaleaveascar

Android,"**What are the popular features that you don't care about? Why?**

Inspired by [this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/iemkq6/whats_one_feature_that_blew_your_mind_that_you/), as I wanted to argue the usefulness almost every feature mentioned there but decided to make a post rather than a dozen comments. We are all different and have different needs anyway.

So I got a Note 9 recently. It's not the phone I'd buy for myself, but my phone died and my girlfriend gave me her Note. Overall it's nice (though I'd love it much MUCH more if it was 5-5.5"") but I noticed that I dislike or don't care about most features people love it for. In my case these features are:

* Fingerprint reader. This is something I could definitely live without. I've had phones with side readers (okay), front readers (so-so) and back readers (from meh to shit). I have to turn my phone over and look for the reader if I want to use it because it's poorly located (next to the camera and not where my index finger goes when I'm using the phone with one hand). Thankfully Note 9 has face/eye unlock, but if it didn't I'd still prefer pattern unlock over the fingerprint reader like I did on my previous phones. Oh and I tried the fingerprint gestures but it resulted mostly in accidental swipes, and on the Note 9 having to look for the reader (so that you don't try swiping on the camera) ruins the feature completely. Anyway Smart Lock makes all the unlocking features less important (now this is a good example of an underrated feature).

* Gesture navigation. I was stoked about it, I tried all the unofficial options (XDA navigation, FNG) and all the official ones, yet I keep coming back to the nav buttons. I really dislike the nav buttons and I welcomed the change unless I tried it out and just couldn't get used to it. Here I will sing praise to Samsung and its Goodlock: NavStar lets you move the buttons to the right for one-handed use. Without this option I'd surely prefer gestures on a phablet like this.

* Voice assistants. I still haven't found any use for Google Assistant besides ""remind me to paint the walls pink tomorrow at nine am"", which is neat but not very useful. It doesn't integrate well with third-party apps that well (being able to seamlessly use it with Todoist would have changed my opionion... perhaps).

* Wireless charging. I have a pad at home but I'd easily give it up. It's extremely useful to people like my gf who forgets to charge her phone otherwise, but it's definitely not a game changer to those who are a bit more organized.

* Always on display. I loved it on dumbphones and early smartphones, but can't get used to it on an OLED screen. Every time I see it I try to turn the screen off only to discover that it was off already. I guess it's more useful if you don't have a smartwatch though.

* The Bixby button. Of course I love the idea of a customizable button, setting up BxActions was one of the first things I did after getting this phone. However so far most of my keypresses were accidental. I guess the location of this button is great if you use the phone with two hands, but I only switch to two hands when I take the S-Pen out. The volume buttons location also sucks for one-handed use btw.

* Samsung Edge Panel. Same, it sounds like a good idea but 90% of time it was accidental wherever I put it. Actually a lot of One UI features like pop-up view sound nice but I can't find any real use for them.

* Telephoto. It may be handy sometimes (though I haven't needed it yet in 1.5 months since receiving the phone) but a superwide would have been way more useful.

* Headphone jack. I still use wired headphones sometimes, and I've used the line in for recording sound but I did the same on my previous phone without the jack and the only ""inconvenience"" was having to use an adaptor. It's nice to have the jack but it's definitely not the hill to die on for me.

* NFC. I think the amount of phones with NFC I've had exceeds the amount of times I've used it. I know you can use it for public transportation or payments in many countries but I don't live in such a country so it's useless to me. I was excited about NFC tags back in 2012 when I got my first phone with NFC but I still haven't come up with a use case for them in the following years.

* OLED screen. Yes, it's nice. But frankly I don't care. I don't care about Pentile and PWM, neither do I care about OLED blacks. I don't know what black smear is, my screen looks and works great (no burn-in so far), the IPS screens I had before looked and worked great as well. Oh and I run it at FHD+ resolution because that looks good enough and I see no reason to use WQHD+.

I guess this post makes me look like some kind of a ""get off my lawn"" guy but actually I'm always happy to embrace the innovations, it's just that most of them end up landing somewhere between ""okay"" and ""meh"". I loved the useful ones: One UI is great (ugly tho) and the S-Pen is absolutely amazing (literally the only thing that makes its size justified, but I'd still like it to be 5-5.5""). I can't say anything about the hyped features I haven't tried (like the high refresh screen).

Android,"Hi all,

I've been looking around for VPNs on mobile since I'm travelling these days and have stumbled over the emerging decentralized VPN approaches I found interesting. Two of those would be [Tachyon](https://tachyon.eco/) or [Orchid](https://www.orchid.com/). This post is about Tachyon.

Since VPNs can easily be an attack vector, I was doing a bit of research but only found a few conclusive reviews about Tachyon (besides prominent[ hype articles](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/this-vpn-could-change-everything-with-its-decentralized-approach)). Nothing too bad neither but usually just [some doubt](https://www.reddit.com/r/techlore/comments/ggxbuv/tachyon_vpn/) in the independent reviews I've seen. They seem to have a rapidly growing userbase though and quite a few downloads on Google Play Store (500k+). They do offer a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tachyon-protocol) which I sifted through but didn't find comprehensive at first glance. I'm not qualified to judge the code though.

But what really raised my suspicion was that their [official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TachyonIPX/) seems to be very ingenuine. The posts are your standard advertising, which is fair. But the comments, so I'm convinced, are altogether posted by bots. All comments share the same one- or two-sentence structure, are all very positive, don't interact, and come from people who's post history only consists of hyping some bitcoin stuff.

If you compare it to other subreddits of apps that could potentially pose some security threat like [YouTube Vanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanced/) (for being an out-of-Play-Store-App), the difference is striking. You'll find some genuine discussions there.

So why would a genuine app that's built on trust and is as security-sensitive as a VPN find themselves with such a subreddit? It certainly raised my suspicion - if you have got any (opposing?) information about Tachyon VPN I'd be happy to hear about it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The official Tachyon VPN subreddit consists of bots. I wouldn't trust that app.

Edit: /u/Rhea-Tachyon has come back with a [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ifh26y/psa_tachyon_vpn_appears_to_be_a_scam/g2sap13?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Android,"Obviously most users impulsively will prefer one-time (or free w/ads) the most and subs the least, and developers the opposite, but let's be honest, a couple bucks one-time payment is not long-term sustainable. And especially on Android, we as users have been spoiled not to accept ""new version, new payment"" like we do in other platforms.

I have a few apps that I'm happy to pay a direct subscription/Patreon for (AutoApps &amp; Tasker &lt;3). But I was wondering about other, non-essential but still useful apps. Generally speaking if there's a free version w/ads available I install that and use it for a while, and if I find it useful I pay for the full version if available. But I'm left wondering if developers would just rather I keep using it w/ads instead of paying one-time. Of course this is not a new question, but now Play Pass is in the game as well.

Initially I was going to make this only a ""free w/ads vs. Play Pass"" thread, but if there are cases of developers preferring a one-time payment or users preferring direct subscriptions I would like to hear it too.","As a user or as the developer, how do you prefer to pay/be paid: one-time payment, Play Pass, free w/ads or subscription?",0.79,58,69,andyooo

Android,"When I bought my tablet, I invested in the [Samsung Tablet Case](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/book-cover-for-samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-oxford-gray/6412383.p?skuId=6412383). While it's well-made and sturdy it's a little pricey as well. However, I wanted a keyboard to go with it. Since Samsung doesn't currently have an official keyboard case for it, I went with the [Fintie Keyboard Case](https://smile.amazon.com/Fintie-Keyboard-Detachable-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B08883JK8Y/) from Amazon.

Unfortunately, I don't find it to be ergonomic at all. While it functions fine for the 2-in-1 keyboard purpose, if I just want to browse it like a tablet it's woefully inconvenient. It's heavier than my other case and the fold itself wants to misalign while I'm holding it. Both of these cause problems for browsing.

When I learned how the magnets worked, I came up with a solution. Now I'm using the former case with the keyboard from the latter. While it won't fold with the keyboard and tablet inside the case, I can attach the keyboard to the top or bottom of the case's exterior. I can simply remove the keyboard when I'm not using it and return to browsing on my more comfortable Samsung case. If I want to take them with me, I simply magnetize the keyboard to the exterior.

Android,"The Nexus 5 rides again!

Coming from flagships only, I was very nervous about the build quality and performance.

The build quality is way better than I expected. It feels very light, as expected, but dense and solid, and not cheap at all. This has the least flimsy, least wiggly buttons of any generation of Pixel device. They are rock solid, and very clicky. I think this is my favorite Pixel so far in terms of hardware. The speakers are a lot better than expected, and I have no complaints with them. Some reviewers talked about imbalance between the two speakers, but I don't experience that.

Performance so far has been great. It feels like a Pixel. There's been no stutter or lag, and while I'm sure you can make it, normal use has not. I've seen a few reviewers mention poor performance, and only ever using flagships made me expect the worst. Hearthstone runs perfectly, so gaming performance is good enough for me. Even touch latency feels great (unlike even the S20 Ultra I owned for a bit).

The screen isn't great. It does get very bright, much brighter than any other Pixel in direct sunlight, and the DPI is perfectly good. But there is a weird faint, shimmery, rainbow look to the display, and when looking at a white screen, the top center has a yellow tint to it. It's far from a bad display, but it's clearly a step down from a flagship.

Haptics are the other weak point that I've found. They just don't feel good at all. Very similar to Samsung, where they are trying to make ""clicks"" and ""thuds"", but you can very much still feel the vibration buzz instead. A big step down from the Pixel 3 and 4, and nowhere close to an iPhone.

I've owned every generation of Nexus and Pixel, and like any sane person, fondly remember the Nexus 5. It was the last time I spent $350 on a phone. The Pixel 4a feels like that phone did, and I'm positive it's going to be remembered in the same way. It makes the right compromises for the price, feels great for the price, and makes you question why other phones cost so much more. Barring any of Google's famous defects and QA disasters, I think this is an amazing phone, and would still be worth it at quite a bit more money.","Pixel 4a First Impressions, Google Totally Nailed It",0.88,299,192,OligarchyAmbulance

Android,"I've now had the pleasure of using the tab S7+ for the past 3 days (thanks to a colleague who had an early review unit), and although it's inevitable that I'll be comparing it to my iPad Pro since it's the tab's direct competitor, and the one to beat--this still is an important moment, and turning point for Android tablets as a whole. Other OEMs, take notes.  

# Hardware:

Holding it, the S7+ is very thin/light, and very enjoyable to carry around. The build quality is extremely solid resembling my iPad Pro (as well as its design). Although the cameras aren't at the same level, they're still good and will do video calling no problem. I'm also surprised at how good the speakers are. To me, they sound just as good as Apple's. However, one noticeable area that I thought could've been better is the log-in metric. I love fingerprint readers on phones--they're fast and reliable, but I really do prefer Face ID much more here since it's more convenient to use, and more secure (especially given the whole in-display fingerprint scandal Samsung had). S-Pen charging is also a bit awkward and not as convenient as the way Apple does it.

The SD 865+ is also a very capable chip, and for the vast majority of apps it's more than enough; however, I did still experience noticeable choppiness in games (like pubg and TFT) and certain apps (like artflow and adobe illustrator) compared to the A12X in my iPad Pro, which I guess was to be expected. The S7+ also got hotter quicker than my iPad Pro, and overall stayed hotter longer as well. I believe this is partly due to the 865+ needing to work harder, but also possible a difference in app optimization. 

At around 350 nits with 120 hertz enabled, I got 5 hours on the tab, and 6 hours on my 12.9"" iPad Pro. 

# Display:

The 120 hertz OLED is beautiful. Gorgeous. Stunning... well...when you can see the picture, that is. What I mean by this is that the max brightness only goes up to 420 nits on the S7+, which on a monitor would be more than fine, but smaller devices needs to be brighter to achieve the same effect. The tab is perfectly ok when using it at night--with little lights on--but during the morning, noon, afternoon, even when I cranked it up to max brightness I still have trouble seeing my screen. It's also much more glossy than my iPad Pro--so that doesn't help, and for reference, the iPad Pro's peak brightness is 600 nits. That's 30% brighter! OLED doesn't mean anything if you can't see the contrast difference Samsung!  

Edit: Forgot about this, but I also found the 120 hertz to be pretty pointless for gaming since you can’t hit nor sustain 120 FPS on a tablet with games like pubg etc with the SD 865+. It’s only possible for the iPad Pro because it has the A12X. A lot of games also doesn’t support 120 FPS to begin with, but it is very smooth and satisfying to scroll through apps. 

Edit: People seem to think I said the screen is worse. Yes, it is when you’re using it next to a window or in a lit area, but the tab’s undoubtedly better. However, my argument was you won’t be able to see your screen much during the day (next to a window or outside) since it’s not bright enough. At night, the tab is better. 

# Drawing/S-Pen:

The update to 9ms latency on the S-PEN is very welcomed. I can see and feel the difference, and it's great. I've been drawing for the past 10 years, and have used many wacom tablets; I would say the S-PEN is better than wacom pens (because of the latency), but falls short of the Apple pencil. In terms of pure sketching (not including app support), I would say the S7+ is slightly better than wacom tablets due to its upgraded latency and 120 hertz (since it uses the same pressure sensitivity as wacom), but not as good as the iPad Pro. Here's why: 

The smaller tip on the S-PEN is not necessarily a good thing when it comes to drawing and sketching. People who draw want broader angles (less compact like the smaller tip but more elongated) because you have more angles and freedom for shading and sketching, and is also easier to draw longer lines. Refer to this [video.](https://youtu.be/TKagPZSLq6Y?t=101) The S-PEN is more like the tri-pod grip but fails when you try to draw lines with the under-hand grip. Whereas the Apple Pencil excels at both, while maintaining the same detail quality as its pointier counterpart. 

The S-PEN also has more line-jitters when you draw, leading to an overall worse experience. App support is also a very important factor. Yes, Android has Artflow and other apps, but they're nowhere near as good as Procreate. Of course wacom is still the best for pro-workflows that heavily rely on app feature set (like animation and Photoshop), but for pure sketching/drawing purposes the iPad Pro is still the best in this regard.   

# Software:

Android on tablet has been getting better over the years, but the reality is it's still not as robust as iPadOS. A lot of pro apps like pro-create, affinity designer, lumafusion, flow, etc simply aren't available on Android. The apps that are available are a step-down compared to its iPadOS counterpart due to lazy optimization, and to add insult to injury, Apple's software support is just much better. You can expect them to support your iPad Pro for a minimum of 5 years and probably more since the A12X is so powerful and future-proof. Although 3 years from Samsung is a good start, it just doesn't make sense to me why someone *wouldn't* spend more to get a better drawing experience, battery life, SoC, longevity, and app ecosystem (unless you're on a budget of course). 

And as amazing as Dex is (better multi-tasking and files system although I’m not too sure about 6GB ram while in Dex), it can't replace a laptop due the lack of apps--it'll probably be far better if you just bought a laptop at that point, or a 2-in-1 that comes with much better hardware, and windows--like the HP ENVY x360 (Ryzen 4700U) that's actually cheaper, but better in every area. If you're only looking to use the S7+ as a tablet/take notes on the side, then the $850+potential keyboard is way too much for what you're getting especially since you can just get a $300 iPad+Apple pencil for half the price. Or, again, you can just get the HP ENVY x360! If you're an artist who wants a tablet to draw on, then the iPad Pro is simply the better product because of the robust apps and drawing experience I explained before. 

# Conclusion:

As you can see, this puts the 7+ in a very awkward position. The iPad Pro has the better apps and drawing experience for artists and designers; the S7+ can't compete with the base iPad pricing for most people that just wants a tablet, or for school, and too expensive and offers too little to compete with laptops and 2-in-1s. It's definitely cheaper than the iPad Pro that it's targeting, but the things you're giving up (like app ecosystem, brighter/less glossy screen, better processor, battery life, and software support) is not worth it in my opinion. 

What Samsung should've done was made a tablet to compete with the Air. Take out the 120 hertz from the 11"" model and switch it with a SD 855 and price it at $400 with a free pen. It would sell like hotcakes. People who want a tablet for media consumption and school (which doesn't rely on app variety since most mainstream media apps are well-optimized) would look at the tab and say ""It looks more futurist, comes with a pen that I can take notes with, and is $100 cheaper than the Air? I'm in!""  

However, Samsung is in luck because Apple decided it's Apple and can price its accessories as much as it wants. SO in total, a 12.9"" iPad Pro+Apple Pencil 2+Magic Keyboard will cost you **$1480!!!** In contrast, the same combo with the tab will cost you $400 less at **$1080.** Now personally I would still pay the $1480 since the Magic keyboard is just so convenient to take off and use from tablet mode to keyboard mode, along with all the other features mentioned before, but I can see how an average consumer will look at both choices and pick the tab over the iPad Pro.

Or you know, just get an [HP ENVY x360](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-13-ay0075nr-envy-x360-13-3-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-4700u-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-black/6411885.p?skuId=6411885) that comes with a freaking **RYZEN 4700U** at $820 with a free pen... It has all the things someone would want from a tablet—touchscreen, pro apps, great build quality, can take notes and be flipped like a tablet for media, and has way more powerful hardware.",My Galaxy Tab S7+ Experience/In-depth Review,0.42,0,106,tekreviews

This is for two reasons:

First: Pixels don't have shutter lag because they are already recording photos before you press the shutter. Shutter lag is defined as the delay between pressing the shutter and capture.

Second: Pixels capture multiple images at higher shutter speeds, breaks then into tiles, and then aligns them. This allows them to deal with subject motion better than any other phone camera.

Android,"I saw this display comparison video between the Galaxy S20 Ultra and the Oneplus 8 Pro. And While both displays look phenomenal, the main difference between those two displays is that the S20 Ultra is more vibrant and can produce 16M colors (8-bit color) while the 8 Pro is more color accurate and can produce 1B colors (10-bit color), which means that the colors can also produce more details. So you would expect the 8 Pro to look better than the S20 Ultra right? Well... yes &amp; no. While it's true that the 8 Pro does have better accurate and detailed colors, it also suffers from black crush that a lot of users have reported on that phone unlike the S20 Ultra. And as a result, the S20 Ultra's display is brighter and more clear than the 8 Pro. Especially if you go to the 3:13 mark, the difference is night &amp; day.

Here's an Android Central article from 2013 reviewing the phones:

""First look: Google Play edition HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 | Android Central"" https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-edition-htc-one-galaxy-s4?amp

Anyway, I was thinking about those phones today and thought, man, if there was a 2020 Samsung or LG or any other top brand that came loaded with stock Android, I would definitely consider buying one. But only if they were offered for sale on the Google Store (or another marketplace that allowed me to finance it at 0%). Back in 2013, they were expensive and there wasn't really a way to finance the hefty price tag. I think that's probably the main reason it didn't catch on.

Android,"I recently bought my first cured screen phone (OPPO X2 Neo which has the same display as the Oneplus 8) and I love it. All the big tech reviewers started to hate it recently, they all complain about accidental touches, glare on the edge, difficult to find screen protector etc. I had none of these issues apart from the fact that you can't get a case with good rasegeviti #Flosy. It's soo much better to swipe from the edge to go back or to use side panels. The glare is there but it's also there with meal edges and the content dosent reach all the way when watching Netflixor YouTube. I haven't experienced waterfall displays like the one on the Motorola Edge or Huewai Mate 30 Pro so can't comment on that.

An interesting read.  I got my first Note, the Note 9, last year on Swappa on a whim and it's been the best phone I've had so far.

What incredible value for $629 renewed on Amazon. Snapdragon 855, 6GB RAM, Android 10, good camera, headphone jack, and its so nice coming from an A70 (just died) to a smaller screen that actually fits in my pocket and not a mid-range SoC.

Android,"The other day I was trying out the Pixel 4 and decided to hook it up with my desktop monitor to watch some shows on a bigger screen. It turns out, it does not support HDMI screen mirroring. I was pretty surprised that such a simple feature wasn't already built into AOSP or Pixel's skin.

Then I tried it with my old trusty Galaxy S9+ and viola! It worked perfectly! Initially, it started to auto-launch Samsung DeX, but I just had to switch to screen mirroring with a single tap. The latency was almost nonexistent, and the picture quality was as crisp as it could get.

The best part, however, was how it allows you to pick an audio output source from your phone! This is a surprisingly rare feature. For example, if I connect my PS4 to my monitor, I am forced to hook up an external speaker to my monitor since most monitors do not support audio. On Galaxy phones, however, Samsung has a special [media control option](https://i.imgur.com/9lKtU5b.jpg) under the notification shade that allows you to use your own phone's speaker (or Bluetooth devices) for audio. I never realized how much of a neat feature that was. You could even output from up to 2 separate Bluetooth speakers at once, a feature I have not yet found on any other phones. Anyways, I think Samsung deserves a lot of praise for these small polishes and unique features.",Can we praise Samsung for providing really good HDMI support?,0.92,515,177,niceneurons
