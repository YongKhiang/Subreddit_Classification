However, opening the same notes on an Android phone or tablet is an exercise in banging my head over and over again against a table.     

----

###Font Support

The font support in Android is paltry. This means any notes typed in fonts other than the (very) few available on Android will revert to Calibri. This is especially problematic for programme code or music notations made in fonts like Lucida Console to maintain spacing.   

###Script Glitches

As long as one types in English or other common Roman scripts, the text is at least somewhat legible. Moving to other scripts results in a disaster, where combined letters are not properly represented and appear disjoint with glitched markers everywhere.  
 
[Example Here.]()   

This does not occur on any other apps: Office or otherwise. Often after OneNote updates, these glitches appear and disappear in different notes based on evidently what the AI's mood is like, or whether the text was directly typed into OneNote (the desktop app) or copied from Word/Excel to OneNote (again on desktop).  

This glitch also regularly occurs on the 'OneNote for Windows 10' app, but luckily I never have to use that again.  

###Text Reflow

Text reflow is a nightmare. Samsung Notes does it well, and so does Microsoft word, where they reflow to adapt to the screen size and don't bounce around. OneNote also does this in theory, but it still retains some padding beyond the screen area which results in the text bouncing around and often overflowing beyond the edges of the screen unless one moves their finger slowly and precisely all the time. There is no (obvious) way to lock this. Here are the video screenshots of notes on Samsung Notes, Word, and OneNote, all typed on Windows and opened on Mobile:    

- [Samsung Notes]()  
- [Microsoft Word]()  
- [OneNote]()  

-----

This is a pity, because OneNote otherwise offers me personally the simplest option for a platform-agnostic Notes app, has decent pen support options, and synchronises with OneDrive. I don't even think these are difficult things to fix. The former two are not a problem in other Office 365 apps, and the latter is a feature of probably every other note or text app on the Play Store.   

I also do not know how the situation in iOS is, but I imagine Apple users use Apple products which I don't have the luxury of doing. OneNote on Android is an unfortunately broken experience",448

0,0.68,35,6,poopyheadthrowaway,"I know the big thing right now is the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and no one cares about the Fold 1 now, but I still thought this was worth sharing. This is more of an impressions post than a review, and I won't be going into depth about benchmarks or camera performance, since there's already a ton of content about that from the past year. My main focus is what it was like to use my first folding phone. Expect this to be full of personal opinions that you probably disagree with. And expect this to be very ranty/stream-of-consciousness.

**Phone history**

1. iPhone 3G (purchased 2010)
2. Moto G 2013 (purchased 2013)
3. Zenfone 2 (purchased 2015)
4. Xperia X Compact (purchased 2016)
5. Pixel 3 (purchased 2018)
6. Galaxy Fold 1 (purchased 2020)

**Why the hell did I buy an old first gen product?** I wanted to try out the whole folding phone thing. I found this on Swappa for $825, which I thought was a fair price, especially since it still has 3 years of security patches left. 

**But isn't the front screen shitty?** Yeah, kinda. But I actually prefer the smaller front display because it's actually usable one-handed. I do wish it were just a tiny bit bigger though--maybe enough to shrink the side bezels. I really dislike how Samsung made the Fold 2 bigger physically instead of just filling out the front display. [This is a picture I made a couple of years ago about my frustration with the evolution of phone design, and I thought it was relevant with the changes from the Fold 1 to the Fold 2](). 

I have a few more thoughts on the front display:

* I would say 80% of the time, I want a phone the size of the smaller iPhones (e.g., iPhone 5), and 20% of the time, I want a tablet, so the Fold 1 is actually working pretty nicely for my personal use cases. Most of my phone usage consists of feeling the phone vibrate (or getting an alert on my watch), taking it out to type up a quick response, and putting it back in my pocket, and I can actually type one-handed!
* I was frustrated when I couldn't use split screen with the front display. But then I found out FNG lets you set up a gesture for split screen, and it works with the front display, so that's what I've been using.

**How's the software?** I mean, as far as the front vs inner display thing is concerned, it works as you'd expect. The main jank is that some apps operate differently depending on the screen size. So if I open Chrome on the front display, it'll use the phone UI, and if I open it on the inner display, it'll use the tablet UI, which is expected, but if I open it on the front display and then open up the phone, it'll continue using the phone UI, and vice versa. But for my uses, this stuff is nbd (insert BoJack Horseman reference here).

Additional thoughts on software:

* This is my first Samsung phone, and honestly, my first impression was that One UI is extremely ugly. I'm Korean, so I should be able to ""get"" their approach to design, but it still leaves a really bad taste in my mouth. After installing Nova Launcher and changing some of the icons, I can stomach it a lot better, but it's still not great. That said, I'm not someone who cares too much about UI aesthetics, so it's something I can tolerate. 
* Samsung bloat is real. I used adb to delete Facebook and LinkedIn, but that doesn't account for Samsung's system apps. Personally, I use Google to sync my files, photos, and contacts, so I ended up installing Google apps for Drive, Photos, Contacts, etc., leaving me with Samsung duplicates that I can't uninstall (if anyone can tell me how to safely uninstall them, please let me know). Thankfully Nova Launcher lets you hide apps from the app drawer, and this phone comes with a whopping 512 GB storage, so it should be fine. That said, I do understand that if someone wants to use their Samsung account to sync their stuff between phones, and they upgrade from an older Galaxy to a Pixel, they might find the ""Google bloat"" to be frustrating for them as well. I just wish they'd let you use whatever account/services you want instead of preloading their stuff on your phone. 
* I still can't get weather info to appear on the AoD. I tried turning it on under FaceWidgets but it still won't show up.
* It seems like I can't remove the persistent notification for AdGuard, which is kinda annoying.
* When I found out Nova Launcher just duplicates your home screens on the smaller front display, I thought it would be really ugly, but it turns out for my setup, it looks fine. [And I'm one of those weirdos who has six apps on their dock](). 

**Durability, build quality, physical design, etc.**

* The phone is a rather bad combination of heavy and slippery. I ended up picking up a case for it. It comes in two parts, to clip onto the front and the back. Unfortunately it seems like every case I could find for this obstructs a big portion of the front, keeping you from swiping in from the bezels (e.g., swiping up to go to the home screen). So I just use the back cover and leave the front unprotected. Which is really all I need for grip anyway. 
* I've heard a lot of people complaining about how the plastic inner screen feels mushy, but it's not something I've noticed. 
* The speakers are really easy to cover up and muffle in landscape mode unless you use it ""upside-down"" (I'm calling it upside-down because that's how the phone expects you to use it in landscape mode by default).
* The notch is definitely annoying. I really wish there were a way to watch fullscreen video with the image just a bit zoomed out so it doesn't go into the notch.
* There are two gaps along the hinge on the back of the phone where I'm constantly afraid that dirt or dust will get in. It's definitely big enough for that. But no issues so far ...

**Battery life, camera, performance, etc.**

* Most reviews cover this, so I'm not going to go into depth here.
* It's hard to gauge battery life because of the pandemic and working from home and all, but it's at least twice as good as my Pixel 3. 
* Daytime photos are great, as expected, but night time photos are unusable, regardless of whether I turn on night mode. But there's a GCam port, so I use that for taking pictures in the dark. 
* My Pixel 3 would constantly kick apps out of memory, but I don't think that's actually ever happened to me yet with the Fold. 

**Final thoughts**

* I wish instead of a notch, they went with something like they did with the S10 where there's a hole punch on the corner. Since most video is 16:9 or 21:9, it would mean that the front camera is not at all an issue when watching stuff full-screen. I also don't understand why they didn't do this with the Fold 2.
* Size-wise, this phone is perfect. [Just small enough for me to wrap my fingers around the entire phone while being able to reach keys on the far edge of the display when typing](). 
* Speaking of size (or well, more like physical dimensions), I think it would make far more sense if it folded out to landscape orientation. The inner display can be 4:3, so when folded, it would be 2:3, which isn't all that strange of an aspect ratio--it's what iPhones used before the iPhone 5. In fact, since the hinge takes up a bit of extra space, it would probably be more like 8:5 or 16:9, which is what we're all used to. But then I'm not a professional hardware engineer or designer, so what do I know.
* Overall, I'm happy with this. A more ""perfect"" version of this would be something with the same size/dimensions, except no notch, and smaller front bezels. 
* Well, I guess this wasn't so brief.
* AMA? Brief impressions of the Galaxy Fold (gen 1)",1390

These can be coped with by using split window mode and flashing custom ROM respectively. Recently after buying a Wear OS smartwatch I've decided to ditch my smartphone entirely and rely on this 5G Tablet + 4G Watch combo. I've been doing well, but some odd things happened along the way:

Samsung has explicitly chosen not to allow their own tablets (or any tablets for that matter) to pair with their own watches. On the setup screen of the Samsung Wearable app you choose which device you want to pair with. If the app is launched on a smartphone, you get to choose from all the Samsung wearables. If the exact same .apk is launched on a tablet, you can only choose their earbuds. Needless to say I had to return my Galaxy Watch and get the Huawei Watch 2 instead.

Furthermore, the Huawei Wear app could not be installed from Play Store at all - ""This item is not compatible with your device"" - downloading and installing the .apk from elsewhere proved otherwise and I was able to pair my watch.

Next up, Android Auto. Same story as with Huawei Wear - unavailable in the Play Store, working perfectly once installed from APKMirror.

My question is: why? Why did 3 different companies (Samsung, Huawei and Google) independently decide to put effort into making Android tablets worse? Android tablets neglected by choice",253

The idea is to emulate the dopamine response of getting sporadic notifications from social networks, without actually being on social networks. It uses your contacts and gallery images as fake sources of content.

I don't think it's actually useful, but thought it was a pretty interesting thought experiment into whether they have the same effect. Would love to hear if there's any merit in the idea (and if it even works 😬)

If you are a WhatsApp user then you know that over time you'd accumulate a lot of phone numbers and eventually all those people will be able to view your WhatsApp profile. I mean sure there isn't much on it in the first place but paranoid as I am I'd still prefer a bit more privacy.

See WhatsApp uses your Contact list to populate it's own contact list for the app. So all your Google Contacts synced and stored on the phone are available in the app. However WhatsApp's privacy options are rubbish - you can choose to share your photo, last seen and about you with **Nobody, Contacts or Everyone** and that's it. Your **status alone gets extended options to share with or exclude selected contacts**.

That means, if you have a contact stored on your phone then you either hide your profile from everyone or you show it to everyone. There is no option to include/exclude certain contacts.

I do not enjoy handing my number out to people who I have casual dealings with, let's say a restaurant or store, and them being able to then access my WhatsApp profile.

So what do you do? If you give your number out to someone, save it for future contact with them then they have access to your WhatsApp profile. The alternative is you don't save their number to your contacts and risk losing it in the call log or store it by writing it down somewhere. Or have two numbers and only give your non-WhatsApp number to people. Or you outright block them on WhatsApp which may not always be possible if your communication is over WhatsApp.

There is no in-between unless WhatsApp decides to improve on their privacy options.

After searching for an answer for a few days and trying contacts sync between multiple Google accounts (spoiler: disabling sync only disables background sync, at some point you may accidentally manually sync and delete your contacts saved in the cloud), I was ready to give up when I saw that the web based Google Contacts app allows you to **hide contacts**:

[]()

&amp;#x200B;

So apart from finally taking a few hours to organize my contacts, I hid all the ones that I no longer need or want accessing my WhatsApp profile: []()

You can also hide multiple contacts: []()

&amp;#x200B;

The hidden contacts end up in the ""Other Contacts"" section:

[]()

&amp;#x200B;

They can be added back to your contacts list by using the ""Add to contacts"" option if desired.

After hiding all unnecessary contacts, I synced with my phone and voila! The only contacts on my phone now are the ones that are important. The rest are hidden, and thus cannot view my WhatsApp profile.

But doesn't that mean the contacts are no longer on your phone as well? Yes it does but they are still accessible albeit with a catch. Opening the **Contacts app** (not the Dialer) and searching will show you the contact **provided you are connected to the internet**. It will show up as ""Other Contacts"" under your gmail account.

[]()

From there you can call them or send an SMS. Further, if you get a call from a hidden contact and are connected to the internet, the caller's saved name will show up after the small bit of time it takes for the dialer to fetch it from your ""Other Contacts"".

Of course this only works if you have internet access in the first place but if you are using WhatsApp you likely would.

And rest assured you will have a way of contacting them in the future but also get some much needed extra privacy in today's world.

This should likely work for other apps that read your contacts to populate their ""find a friend"" lists like Snapchat, Telegram and whatever else the cool kids are using these days.

I hope someone finds this useful. Getting some extra privacy in WhatsApp (and possibly other apps) from your Google Contacts",655

0,0.82,146,73,LankeeM9,"Preface: I've been using an early very build of a ROM on Android 11, the ROM includes almost nothing (the dark mode isn't even amoled) and is very close to aosp, even closer to stock than a Pixel. (This is not a GSI)

Launcher changes: I've used both quickstep (aosp android launcher) and I've flashed the Pixel launcher.

Wallpaper zoom animations during:
- App drawer open 
- Quick settings pull down
- Opening recent apps
- Opening/Closing an app using gesture navigation

Gesture animations:
- Slight change to home gesture animation feels more ""crisp"" (Probably a placebo but I felt a difference)
- When going home from an app that has no place to go on the home screen, the card animates significantly more smoothly into a circular shape then and disappears

Launcher Functionality:
- Apps can open into landscape (might be old)
- When going home from an app in landscape the launcher will stay in portrait (BIG CHANGE)
- Swipe up on any page to go to the first page
- Quickstep does not have the select button in recent apps for OCR

Other animations:
- Swiping between pages has a little bounce
- When removing an app from recent apps the next card will bounce into place. 

SystemUi Changes:

- Improved keyboard animations (to be fully utilized they need to be implemented by the developer) 
- The keyboard appears significantly faster
- Improved rotation animation
- Significantly improved screenshot animation
- When pulling down quick settings on the lock screen the media player will ""jump"" into place
- When setting a wallpaper it will slightly zoom in to facilitate the new animations

I'm certain their are way more under the hood refinements as the system as the system feels really smooth and fast for such an early build of a barebones ROM. 

In conclusion it feels really smooth and fast and I don't want to go back to Android 10 even though there are alot of ROM side issues. I do hope Google does add alot more features next time though. Android 11 is a great step into the refinement of the OS",334

After all that time, what I really hate is that every company, and google itself, says that is a Fast Method to share  they didn't say how long it takes to share something.

I mean, first of all, you need to have Wifi, Location, and Bluetooth always  why???
Lemme explain, even if you want to share something using mobile data, it will make you turn on Wifi. The phone that will recieve the file will connect to you mobile data to make the WiFi-Direct  why do I have to turn it on if I'm sending it?

Second,  totally USELESS. Everybody says ""You need it to find the other device""  that doesn't make sense when you also use Bluetooth.
Also, who goes with the location always on? If you want to share something you need to turn it on, and ask the other person to turn it on, it makes the process really annoying and makes you think ""Why am I doing this..I can send it via Whatsapp/Telegram Uncompressed""
You will need to turn it on every time you want to share/receive sth, because it will drain your battert if you leave it turned on the whole day.

Bluetooth has no problem with that, as it has the LE tech.

Google should remove the location from Nearby Share, cause it has no sense. Nearby  a ""Quicker method""?",240

This is not particularly related to Android, but I do think it's a great tool to use on websites you might visit on a regular basis to keep up on Android news, or for websites that you use to download APK's and other tools that you cannot find on the official Play Store.

0,0.68,19,6,gniguhcraig,"So I was just thinking about how to improve widgets on Android and came up with an idea that could create a multifaceted improvement between both Android's widgets and WearOS' complications. Essentially, I think that creating a single API that works concurrently for both platforms could expand the use cases and developer support for both platforms.

Apps would simply designate specific portions of their application's data sets along with a label of sorts to allow widgets and complications to aggregate the data into 3rd party widgets that are designed for the API and WearOS watch faces that support complications. 

This is more or less how the complications system works on WearOS already but the issue is the market isn't very saturated with WearOS users at the moment. Subsequently, complication support (though fairly simply for app developers to implement) isn't as widespread as it could be. By transposing the complication's system over to widgets on the Android side, application developers would have a significantly larger user base to cater to and would be much more likely to implement the new, cross-platform complication system into their apps. 

This could spark a resurrection in the widget space, with customizable widget apps being much more user friendly as a result. Users creating a custom widget could aggregate data from multiple sources by simply selecting the corresponding activity/complication from a list. 

Some use case ideas I have for this would be to create a ""control center"" esque widget similar to what iOS offers but with all your own custom complications. Toggling things from different manufacturers simultaneously like smart home switches/routines, wearable toggles (like the battery level/sound profile/ambient sound setting on a pair of wireless headphones), and having data aggregated like your current monthly data plan usage all in one cutomized widget panel would look pretty damn sleek in my opinion. Or maybe a fitness center that combines toggles for workouts, headphone setting, and health tracking data from various different apps/developers all into one widget would be a much cleaner look than having multiple, seperate widgets with varying designs all situated on a single page of your app launcher.

Much the same, assuming app developers enable this feature for their apps various toggles/data points due to widget support greatly expanding their use case scenarios and general usage overall, WearOS watches would have access to a ton more complications than before! Being able to say, have a watch face that has health data displayed from Google fit, weather data from an app like Dark Sky (yes, I know Dark Sky is gone), and some toggles for headphones (like toggles for ambient sound and enable/disable touch controls for bluetooth headphones like the Galaxy or Pixel buds) on a 3rd party WearOS watchface would be amazingly customizable and offer significantly more options than any other wearable platform does currently (honestly, WearOS is already the best at this). One could use this feature to aggregate their calendar app's next event onto the watchface of their choosing as well! 

What do you guys think? I can't imagine this sort of thing would be too difficult to implement and would be highly customizable for both widgets and complications if done correctly. There could be some conflictions at first (like a complication circle on a watchface being unable to display something like a calendar event, for example) but users could easily just change the setting to something else if an issue of this nature arises! Interesting idea for both Android widgets and WearOS",578

I hope this post is not against the rules of this subreddit. 

I used to have terrible anxiety and depression so I have developed a app called Raah. 



Sometimes we cannot focus on simple things and are blocked the entire day or maybe even weeks because we have something in our mind which is bothering us and we don't have the correct person to talk to without the fear of being judged. 

The purpose of this app is you can talk to someone and share out your frustrations, sorrows or just speak your mind.

You can also listen to someone who wants to be heard and feel glad that you just gave some time and attention to someone and made them feel better.. 

Despite having so much social media around do you feel you can truly express yourself or connect with someone.
 

All this happens while you remain anonymous. The app is purely text chat based no audio,video ,no image sharing, no meme's nothing. Just straight text to help conceal your identity.  

**Please Please bear with us , We know for every talker request 2 notifications goes and its annoying we are working on it. Do not uninstall the app for this you can disable the notifications, we have this option within the app.**


If you find any suspicious permissions please let us know we will remove it. So far we are using basic internet and notifications.  

**Known issues:** 

1. A person waiting for more than 2 minutes is ejected without any information

1. Sometimes for every talker request 2 notifications are sent. 

Note: 

1. I am aware this concept may have flaws, talking to a stranger is not ideal or advisable but for topics like breakup, job loss, feeling worthless it does help talk to someone and get motivated.   

1. Raah is not a replacement for suicide hotline / professional therapy/counselling. 

1. We just use the phone number for verifying if you are a real user and protecting users against  trolls. **If you guys have any ideas on how to protect this platform against trolls please reach out to us.** 

1. We plan to delete the chat data every 24 hours unless an incident is reported for moderation purpose. 

1. Raah at this stage does not support end to end encryption yet but we do want to add soon. 

1. We are still in beta right now consider things to be broken. If you find any bugs, have any suggestions or feedback do send us here 

1. We do want to be open source soon. I have developed a app which is trying to help cope with depression. I am looking for beta testers",448

0,0.76,54,68,imzaeem,"Over the past 10 years, I've had the privilege of using every Samsung flagship phone (except for the S20). So, I was pretty excited to get my hands on the Note 20 Ultra and see how it compared to my Pixel 4XL and iPhone 11 Pro.

Here are some of my thoughts after using it for 3 weeks. [I also made a video review]() (it's my first time making a tech video).

**The good**

* The screen is beautiful and the 120Hz refresh rate is an amazing addition this year to the note 20
* Performance is top notch and the 12GB RAM ensures you won't have to reload apps much
* Cameras are amazing. The main sensor has improved a lot and the low light performance is a big step up. The 50x zoom camera on the note 20 is really good in bright conditions, but it's not amazing in low light. Also, 50x is more of a gimmick. For best results, treat the 50x zoom lens as a 5x lens
* Build quality is great and the in-hand feel is amazing. The note 20 is a beautiful looking device and arguably one of the best phones Samsung has ever made
* The S-pen on the Note 20 Ultra is ultra smooth. The low latency really makes it feel like you're writing on paper (without the paper feel)
* The level of customization Samsung offers is really good! I LOVE Good Lock and I wish it was available on more devices
* Samsung Dex is a very underrated feature of the phone. Love the ability to connect it to a monitor and access my stuff that way. Due to lockdowns, there hasn't been a bigger need to use Dex, but I expect to use it a lot more while traveling

**The not(e) so good**

* The resolution of the screen must be dropped to 1080 in order to use 120Hz refresh rate on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which can be noticeable while reading a lot of text. I did get used to it after a couple days, but every time I went back to my Pixel 4XL or iPhone, I could tell the screens were sharper on those phones. I wish Samsung included a 90Hz option with full resolution
* The battery is good enough for one day, but would be nice to have a bit more buffer there 
* The 50x zoom camera could use a bigger sensor. The low light performance is not great, which limits the use case. I'd recommend only using when there's plenty of light available
* The phone requires you to use both hands to use comfortably. Depending on your preference, the large size of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can be a bit much 
* Software is a bit buggy. The gestures aren't as smooth as you'd find on a Pixel device. Sometimes, the navigation gestures stop working all-together, which can be a bit frustrating

Overall, it's pretty incremental upgrade over last year's note. It's still worth the $1300 USD if you want the latest and greatest, but you can definitely get similar features for a lot less (minus the S-pen). Honest thoughts on the Note 20 Ultra after using it for 3 weeks",529

0,0.62,89,171,Demonicheesburger666,"	I have been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4, but not exactly… avid. After the iPhone 8 and X came out, instead of upgrading to one of those, I just bumped up to the 6S. Finally this year, I was ready to get a new phone. I wasn’t quite ready for a 700-1100 dollar upgrade, so you can imagine my excitement when the SE 2nd generation came out. But… problems still arose.

	I decided to wait a bit, my friend had gotten the SE, and I waited to hear about his experiences before getting one of my own. After all, it was basically just the iPhone 8 with a year or two more updates, but for $150 dollars more. And I consider myself a tech guy, keeping up with it if not buying it all. So, the bezels the size of a parking lot were growing old to me, and no phone in 2020 should have them, even a mid-ranger. 

This is when I started considering leaving the realm of Apple and looking around at Android phones. I had a few options in mind- Samsung Galaxy A70, the OnePlus Nord, and the Pixel 4A. Right off the bat, I gave up on the Nord, since they aren’t sold in America. And between the A70 and Pixel 4a, I went with the Pixel mainly due to the 50$ less, and the fact that it has guaranteed 3 years of updates.

So, after a month(way too long to ship, by the way, but it won’t affect my review), the phone came in. It was super simple to set up, I just plugged my 6S into it and backed it up, and then switched my SIM into it. And then- the magic began.

Right off the bat it took me a bit of time to get adjusted to AndroidOS, but after a day or two, I was used to it. But after that… I started noticing the things that it does so much better then iOS. The always-on display, the app drawer, the notifications, and above all- the customization. I wondered why everyone wasn’t using this, the software was so much better! After a bit of thought and talking to my friend with the SE, I drew this conclusion-

iPhones are for people who aren’t into technology. If you just want a phone, and you want it to do what you need it to, and you don’t really care about price, then iPhone is the way to go. It works for people who aren’t into tech because its just… simple. Nothing fancy, nothing complicated, nothing ugly. Just… simple. But for them to be so simple, they have to take away some features, and they choose which ones to take away by predicting whether the average user uses that feature frequently. And while this isn’t a problem for people not into tech, those who are start to notice the missing features. And they start to want them back. So they switch to Android. Maybe a little more complicated, but they’re ok with it, because they get to have their customizations.

So when I got my 4a, I immediately took advantage of those customizations. I did everything I could to make the phone feel like… mine. With my iPhone, all I could do was change the wallpaper and shuffle my apps around on the home screen. With my Pixel, I could change the widgets, fonts, arrangement of apps, icon shape of apps, and so much more. It just felt more like MY phone instead of A phone. Now I could go into specifics of the Pixel itself, but it has some things that not all Android phones have.

So my final recommendation to Apple users considering switching to Android- would you be comfortable with learning how to use a phone over again? It might be weird for a day, a week, or even more- but the end result is so much better.


EDIT- I didn't mean that iPhone is bad, or that I dislike people who use them, I couldn't care less if you like Apple or not. I meant that to me, personally, iPhone just feels more like a stock smartphone experience. I apologise for my poor phrasing. My experience switching from iPhone to Android",705

0,0.87,176,139,MishaalRahman,"Hi Reddit,

I've seen a lot of interest here in the LG Wing, a quirky new smartphone with a display that swivels to reveal a smaller display underneath.

LG sent me the Wing yesterday and I've been playing around with it to find out if this form factor makes sense. If you have any questions about the Wing, I'll try to answer them as best I can.

Just keep in mind that LG sent reviewers including myself a pre-production unit, so we aren't allowed to do certain things like benchmarks or dive too deep into our experiences with the device. 


If you want to see the device in action, 
[my colleague Ben posted a hands-on of the Wing on XDA]() and I also shared a few pics of it [on Twitter.]() I'll be putting my own thoughts together on the Wing after spending a bit more time to appreciate (or nitpick) its quirks. Ask Me Questions about the LG Wing!",157
0,0.79,56,50,FatCat0,"Example: app needs to download things to your phone (say music or an audiobook), the only permission available is file access. All it really needs is a local folder to download stuff to, not access to everything stored on my phone. 

I would love some other qol options, like timed permissions (sure, have access to my GPS or microphone for half an hour while I'm using you then ask again next time), but it's just overall odd to me that they have permissions for some degree of security but many times only give the option of ""way more access to your phone than necessary or nothing at all"". I get that it simplifies things, but that's something of a weak argument because it's easy enough to have an ""east mode"" that functions just as the current setup does, and giving developers the tools and encouragement to localize their use of people's phones is only a good thing in my book. Is there a reason Android doesn't have an option for better permission granularity?",173

0,0.56,13,38,TahPenguin,"As probably many of you, I have also wondered which of the two I should get.

So I ordered both and compared.

Right out of the gate the Redmi makes a better impression. It's thinner and slicker, feels more premium in your hand. It's actually surprising how 0.5mm in thickness makes such a big difference.
Don't get me wrong, the X3 is well built, for a budget phone, but it does feel chunky in comparison.
Redmi is a much bigger fingerprint magnet. I barely see anything on the back of the X3. It's probably due to the glossy finish of the 9 Pro since it has a Gorilla Glas 5 back and the X3 is just a simple plastic shroud.

**Performance:**

and that is a BIG surprise. The Poco X3 is SLOWER or the same, according to Geekbech5. I ran them side by side, a couple of times.
I've disabled all background apps and restarted both devices before running the tests.

The Redmi scored around 570 Single Core and 1770 Multicore, quite consistently.

The Poco X3 scored around 570 Single Core and 1700 Multicore, with the lowest score of 1530 for the Multicore.

I believe this is because the X3 seems to have worse cooling. But I'm not sure. The X3 does get hot when running those benchmarks while the Redmi was just a bit warm.

But it is staggering! The 732g is supposed to be quite a bit faster than the 720g in the Note 9 pro. Something is amiss here.

The CPU Identifier for the Redmi reads:

ARM implementer 81 architecture 8 variant 15 part 2052 revision 15

While the Poco reads:

ARM implementer 81 architecture 8 variant 13 part 2052 revision 14

So they do seem to be different CPUs, at least on paper.

.

The GPU Benchmarks are weird as well. They both have the same GPU, Adreno618, but the scores differ from software to software.

I used the Geekbech5 Compute Benchmark and the V1 GPU Benchmark Pro on the play store, as these two had the best review score.

Here's the interesting part: the Poco did NOT like the V1 benchmark. It scored terribly, much, much lower fps and scores compared to the Redmi.
We're talking 4100 vs 3000 points in the Village Benchmark at 1080p. Multiple runs, as always. And 3000 was not the lowest for the Poco, it really struggled in this benchmark.

The Geekbench5 Compute Benchmark showed a different story. Here the X3 scored a consistent 1300 points while the Redmi was around 1230. 3 Runs each.

I'm not sure what is wrong with the V1 benchmark and the Poco. Maybe it's the heat problem again? Since the Geekbench Compute Benchmark didn't really heat up either of the devices, but the V1 did, and considerably so.

**Screen:**

One of the very compelling arguments for buying the X3 is its 120Hz screen, a first for a phone in this price bracket.
But it's a difficult bet, in my opinion.

You can see the difference when running the UFO test. So if you're a mobile gamer and think you need high refresh rate - this might be it. But it is not very noticeable in day to day use. That's coming from someone who bought a 144hz monitor as soon as I could, couple of years ago.

The X3 does feel a bit more responsive and that might be due to its advertised 240Hz polling rate for the touch sensor.

What I don't like in the Poco is how it handles brightness. Maybe it's a bug, it is a new phone afterall, but at the lowest brightness, the app icons are still pretty bright. Brighter than the wallpaper by a bit. It seems like not much, but it did hurt my eyes a bit when I was playing with the phone at night.
The 9 pro seems to have a very consistent dimming of the screen.

Either way, there are 3rd party apps that dim your screen, so it should not be a dealbraker.

**Speakers:**

Here's where the Poco shines. The stereo speakers are great. They sound good, watching videos is fun, listening to music is nice and so much so that you don't always need a BT speaker. The phone gets pretty loud.

The speaker on the Note 9 Pro is just that. A speaker. Not terribly loud but enough for everything you might want to use your phone for.

The X3 is a clear winner here.

**Cameras:**

Nothing to write home about. They are pretty much the same. The wide angle has a higher resolution on the Poco(8v13mpx), and it's noticeable, but the Macro camera is worse(5vs2mpx).
Personally I think the ultra wide is far more important for day to day use, but I don't understand why you would limit your macro camera just to 2mpx, just don't include it if you want to cripple it by that much.
Quality is a bout the same on either of the main cameras, but overall due to the better wide angle I'd say the X3 wins here, even if it's just ever so slightly.

**Battery:**

Although the X3 has 160mAh more packed into its battery, it drains it faster, even at 60hz. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is a solid 2 day phone. The X3 will last you one day and a bit.
According to AccuBattery from play store, I get almost 14h of screen time on the Redmi and only 8,5h on the X3@120hz, that number jumps to around 10,5h@60hz.

Furthermore, I get way better ""mixed use"" stat. Meaning just normally using the phone. The Note 9 Pro gets 60+h of mixed use, while the X3 gets around 35h.

The Redmi wins here big.

**Various:**

What is worth mentioning is that the Redmi Note 9 Pro has a slot for 2 sim cards AND a microSD card, while the Poco fits either one sim and one SD, or two sim cards.
If you travel a lot and need two sim cards, the redmi is your phone then. Assuming you also need a microSD card.

**In conclusion...**

I think there are no clear winners, which is a shame. I think Xiaomi could've made a killer phone out of the X3. It has all the right specs on paper, but the execution is not always as good as one would expect and the performance numbers are very surprising, considering the all new Snapdragon 732g.
If a 120Hz screen and stereo speakers are a must for you and you're on a tight budget, then the Poco X3 is your only option.
Other than that I think the Redmi Note 9 Pro makes a better impression and FEELS better in the hand, which is not something to overlook. The X3 is a little brick, in comparison.
If you can wait, Xiaomi is supposedly about to release a Redmi Note 10 anytime soon, so maybe if you wait a month or two you can get the best of both worlds. Poco X3 vs Redmi Note 9 Pro - is X3 a flop? A review",1124
0,0.37,0,15,simbolmina,"I am not sure this is right place to discuss but I have a tought about recent epic vs apple/google battle over market cut. Seeing this lawsuit as an oppurtinity and see a better change is my wish.

As you know Apple sells devices and give them 5 year update for free. There is no any  android device manufacterer offering same service including google itself. Apple wants and can do that 'cause they are keep gainin money via market sales and service sales like icloud. That's why and how they can afford updating and service costs to older phones, tablets, computers, etc. 

There is no similar situation for android makers expect Google itself and they are very small player in this regard. I believe the key of changing this situtation is sharing some percent of market gain to device manufacturer. If you buy something on a device, then google should give them their share. Market cut won't be 30% but 15% and 3-5% of 15% will be going to device manufacturer. There are some reasons and benefits doing so and I will share them below. 

Reasons and benefits

1. %30 is too much. All cost is checking software whether it is working or safe and managing market, servers, bandwith etc. You don't need phisical warehouses, transportation costs unlike phisical stores. 30% is an older paradigm and should be changed. This way developers will gain more and user will spend less. Only loser is Apple/Google and it's still a good money. 
2. Yes, Google is owner and developer of android (despite it's an open source software) but phone makers don't simply download android and install it to phones like PC makers. They optimise OS, create suitable softwares and services for their hardware and this way they contribute Android platform. Most of Android feautures are created by device makers. Everyone would admit that Samsung did make Android a better OS in most way. For example; foldable phones are here and Android itself is not optimized for this; device makers make it possible. Then google will (or have done recently) add this feature to Android itself. We can't possible determine who contribute most and who will have X percentage but even making Adroid One devices means contribiting overall Android platform and deserve some part of it. Share percentage may be defined via some contract by device makers and Google and each of them deserve some part of tha gain. 
3. Device makers now only can earn money by only selling devices yet they simply have to keep their devices up to date and add features and doing this costs money. But on the other hand Apple and Google keep profiting by selling software on markets and selling services and this is not possible for device makers. Samsung tries some but we can't compare their market share since it's very small in comparision (their markets and services I mean). But updating devices requires resources and this can only be accomplished by having some part of market and service gain. %3-5 share would be enough for this and only this way any phone maker can support 4-5 years of update warranty.
4. Since only way of earning more money for device makers, making as much as garbage devices and fill the market with them and then forgeting about them after a short while. Having some google play share now device makers will have a continious gain over their devices and they will have a good reason to up to date their devices. They will benefit of their devices' longer lifespan. That means less garbage device with better hardware and maybe with better prices. Less hardware resources leads a better environtment and less money spent by costumers. 
5. Since market will have less kind and mostly updated devices, developers can optimize their software better and easer and consider/support older hardwares (lower tier CPUs, lower RAM etc). This means overall better user experience, beter development process and better environtment. And offer to revision to 30% market (GooglePlay) cut and sharing it with Hardware Manufacturers",675

Fast forward to today and things are starting to feel very different. We have the new apple watch that was announced yesterday which is looking better and better. Hugely customizable and just a very cool looking device. The only problem is, you need an iPhone to own one. Fortunately the parity between phones is almost identical these days. Most popular apps are on both. Each allow you a good level of customization now. Ios 14 added home screen widgets for instance.

Where's the great Pixel Watch?  Even out of the gate I can't imagine it doing an 8th of what the apple watch does because they've been iterating on it for years. The Wear OS on the other hand is just barely not abandonware.

0,0.77,53,79,Mujutsu,"I would like to open a discussion about your experience regarding any type of UI lag or strange slowdowns on your phone.

Let me make it clear, that this does not include slower loading times for various applications because of lower-spec hardware. I am only talking about issues that have either appeared a while after using your phone (so not there from the start) or they have been there from the start but are disruptive enough for day-to-day use that you think they should be included here.

I will also give some examples from my personal experience which actually made me create this post:

 - on my Galaxy Note 8: I am having some random issues with general UI lag. For example: when unlocking the phone, starting applications and using applications, the phone sometimes drops some serious frames which makes the experience ""choppy"" or ""stuttery"", for lack of better terms. This doesn't happen all the time, but it's become more and more noticeable as time passed.

 - also on my Galaxy Note 8: extreme delay in opening apps. It's not related to a specific app, but sometimes (again, not always) when I try to open an app (banking app, Google maps, etc) the app simply doesn't open right away. Sometimes it's not an app per se, but the keyboard inside the app that takes eons to load (Gboard). I try to open it again and 5 to 20 seconds later all the actions I have previously tried start happening in quick succession, like the phone just got past a roadblock and is just now processing all my inputs. The app pops up, the keyboard shows up and disappears, it's generally a huge mess and it settles down after a few seconds and everything is usable again.

 - on my Exynos S20+ 4G: my S20+ is definitely much smoother than the Note 8, but it sometimes has the same problems, albeit at a much lower scale: stutters when opening applications, delays when opening keyboard (1-3 seconds), delays when opening an app (just the other day I tried opening Reddit Boost and it took 10 seconds for it to load).

I would like to figure out from this post the following:

 - if you're also experiencing such issues
 - if issues of such severity are limited to Samsung or specifically to Exynos, or are normal on a wide range of devices and operating systems. I experienced such issues on my iPhone 11 Pro Max, but with much lower intensity.
 - if after experiencing such issues you have found a solution on how to ameliorate or even eliminate them.

Over the years, my family has become geographically disperse, so I can no longer drop by to fix something in person. Fortunately, technology has made it possible to do tech support over the web. I thought I share my experience.

**Degree of interaction**

Sharing comes in different levels, the two level I see is:

1. You can see the remote screen, but can’t make changes.
2. You can see and interact with the remote screen, but only with the remote user’s approval.
3. You can see and interact with the remote screen unattended.

If the person is knowledgeable, I favor option #1, because you are making the other user do the work, this often result in them learning how to do it themselves. For really non-technical users, the ones that may have difficulty just turning on the computer, option #3 is the way to go. However, you may be limited to what the system permits.

**Remoting Software**

The following are software that I have used. There are probably more that are not listed. That does not mean they don’t work, but that I haven’t tried them.

Chrome Remote Desktop

Teamviewer

AnyDesk

AweSun

Chrome Remote Desktop – Supports remote access of Windows, linux, macOS and chromeOS from Android, iOS, chromeOS, linux, and Windows. Access is within the browser.

Teanviewer – support remote access of Windows, MacOS, Android, and Linux from windows, MacOS, Android, and linux. In my opinion, cross platform-wise, teamviewer is probably the most comprehensive, it’s the only product that can remote to older Android phones.

For Android phones, Teamview must have a plug-in for or you can’t remote control it. You can look up what brand is supported.

Team mobile offers a product call Teamviewer Host that allow you to have unattended access. In practice, this doesn’t really work all that well. The host typically shutdown after the screen goes out even if you turn off eco-mode and make sure that host is protected.

Another issue is that Teamviewer has increase their push to get people to sign up. This mean you may get flagged as commercial usage, which reduces your session to 5 minutes.  You can email them to get it removed, but it may take a week. From what I can determine, accessing Teamviewer from more than a single computer will result in “commerical usage” detected. In addition, I also found the recent software to be really unstable.

AnyDesk – support remote access of Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and FreeBSD to  Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and FreeBSD. Supposedly started by former employees of Teamviewer. The interface is very similar.

Like Teamviewer, it will support remoting to phones. For Android phone, you must have Android 5 or later to share screen and Andorid 7 or later for interaction. Like teamviewer, the interactive part requires a plug-in to be installed.

Awesun – Similar to Anydesk ,but supports windows, macos, ios, and android but apparently not linux. Seems to be a very similar product to Anydesk and have roughly the same requirements.

**Remote Recommendation by Platform**

The following is my observation of accessing the different platform. You may wonder why I don’t have IOS or Mac. This is because none of my relative use the two platforms.

Windows

My preference is to use Chrome Remote Desktop. It works pretty well and you can actually set it up to connect unattended. AnyDesk and Teamviewer will work, too.

ChromeOS

You are pretty much stuck with Chrome Remote Desktop and you cannot setup the chrome os to connect unattended. To connect, the person must send you a one-time remote code. Using Chrome Remote Desktop to access ChromeOS is not ideal. ChromeOS looks like the chrome browser so you are displaying ChromeOS inside your chrome browser, so it can be confusing because you have 2 layers of tabs.

Android

My preference currently is to use AnyDesk. Chrome remote desktop doesn’t work with accessing Android. Teamviewer has a bad habit of disconnecting or have false-positive that you are using it commercially. Another reason is that unattended access actually works most of the time.

However, if you have a phone that is older than Android 7, you have to use Teamviewer and you can only use it if there is a compatible plugin.

Linux

I don’t have anyone who uses Linux, but I imagine Anydesk will work.

**Security**

Using any remote product will increase your security risk. Accessibility and security is a balancing act. I wouldn’t have my relatives install remoting software if they didn’t need my help. Make sure all host are protected by a really secure password. I also warn the user that they should not accept request for connection unless they come from me.

I also know nothing about the secuciry of the different vendors. I don’t know how secure they are and what information they may be collecting. In the case of Google, I am pretty sure they will try to make sure Chrome remote desktop is secure since it impacts their credibility. I have very little info on Anydesk or Awesun.

Just to be on the safe side, I typically run remote access through a VM running linux and the linux box has only external access to the internet. No use burning myself helping others.

**UPDATE**

I take back what I said about AnyDesk. While implement-wise it seems faster than Teamviewer, it's got a bunch of issues.

* On Android, there are instances when the screen blanks out. I am not sure why, but I think it may actually be a feature because it blanks out on certain things that you may want to blank out. For example if you remote to your android and then pull up a site for Charles Schwab, Mint, or last pass, the screen goes blank. The problem with this is that this limits its use as a tech support tool.
* On android, I have had situations where any desk can connect to the machine but the screen is blank. It may be related to the previously mentioned blanking.
* On android, there is no navigation buttons on the bottom like in Teamviewer, so for example, I can't go home. The workaround is to use the hotkeys like CTRL-ALT-Shift+Home to go home.

I also notice that Teamviewer has fixed a previous issue which is session dropping after inacctivity. It still does that, but when you reconnect, it will wake up the session now. So Teamviewer may still be the only way to go if you want Android remote.

0,0.75,46,41,Human0820,I tried this with an app called hidden settings for MIUI. I don't know if this works for other phone but this worked on my Redmi note 8 and you can probably do this on other Redmi devices with a fingerprint sensor. So you open the app after you have downloaded it from the playstore. Then you click on fingerprint sensor test and click the check mark for module quality test. Click run at the bottom right of the screen and put you finger on the sensor. For me a exclamation mark came up but then it exited out of the test real quick. You have to click the exclamation mark very very quickly to see the fingerprint picture and before it goes away. It only stays for a split second so I screen recorded it so I can go back through the frames. That's it. Android isn't supposed to show that but with the app you can see it.

0,0.94,525,69,j0hnl33,"The ZTE z2332cc is an interesting device. It's a Consumer Cellular branded phone (a cell phone carrier that targets primarily older people) that runs Android, but can hardly be considered a smartphone, as it has no app marketplace at all, no web browser, and no touch screen. 

[Single image]()  
[Gallery]()  

The features it include are text messaging, camera, FM radio, calls, image gallery, clock (timer, alarm), contacts, media player, calendar, calculator, settings, and file manager.

I was setting up this new flip phone for my grandma and was very surprised to find that it actually runs Android. However, even though Android is what powers it, there's no Google Play Store or even a browser (though kind of makes sense since there's no touch screen to interact with it.) It does have a file manager and SD card slot, so maybe it's possible that you could side load APKs to it, though I can't imagine my 91 year old non-tech-savvy grandma would like that. However, aside from the fact there's no touch screen (which would make it very hard to interact with the majority of apps), I believe it could run into issues as I suspect they have taken out several parts of Android.

I was shocked, as last time I had a basic feature phone (non-smartphone) back in 2012, they all had their own proprietary OSs. I wouldn't have expected this switch, as while Android is a great OS for smartphones, I'd have thought it would be unnecessarily heavy for a basic feature phone (making it need a more powerful processor, more RAM, and a larger battery than otherwise necessary.) However, the box said this uses a Qualcomm processor (didn't specify which), so my guess is that with economies of scale, it is cheaper to just use a low-end Qualcomm processor than manufacture a custom low-end SoC for a phone that caters to a very small audience. With it using a Qualcomm processor, they probably thought it'd be cheaper to just use Android versus build their own proprietary OS for a phone that likely doesn't sell much.

Still, I was surprised they barely even changed the default AOSP look even if it ran Android underneath. But I guess they know their target audience doesn't care about a custom UI. 

Though it may look like they just loaded AOSP onto it and added buttons to interact with the UI, I think they removed several components of Android, as it has very good battery life so far in my limited testing. 

One last thing I found interesting, this may be the first phone I have ever seen that supports 4G LTE, but has no WIFI or browser. Even some basic feature flip-phones with no touch screen now use Android underneath",457

0,0.84,402,260,azorsenpai,"Hi , I was thinking about one thing when looking on this sub and one thing struck me like a truck : nothing really justifies buying a new phone other than the desire for change or pleasuring yourself (well not like that weirdo , hear me out ). Before you changed phones because the new one was so powerful that it made your previous phone look like garbage. 
When the Galaxy s2 got out , it creamed everything existing so hard on power and video decoding that it was outrageous, the s3 ? Even perfected that , it even had LTE for the first time and TWO WHOLE GIGS OF RAM OH MY LORD. And that was it , in two years only your galaxy s1 was not even useful as a paperweight compared to what was available at that time.

Now look at us , look at a phone that is two or even three years old , what did we gain ? 
Yeah slightly bigger screens , slightly smaller bezels , ever so slightly better cameras. Look at the pixel 4a , it uses the same sensor as the old Pixel 2 and yet , compare it to the top notch Note 20 ultra and tell me : are you able to objectively tell me ""yeah this is so much worse"" without pixel peeping ? Hell even when I'm actually zoomed all the way in I can't tell sometimes. And that is 3 year old hardware! 

Oh and well we had our fair bit of regressions also in the meantime:
- losing the headphone jack
- notches and holes in the screen (tbh I like these but I'd understand why people would not) 
- slower , less reliable under display fingerprint sensors
- the near death of expandable storage
- 1K+ Prices
- curved displays without having the choice (granted these already existed in the s6 era but at least you had the choice)
- locked to the bone bootloaders and nothing to do what you want with your own expensive mini computers (which now even cost more than one...) 

Yeah it's all pretty ... Plain , I don't even feel excited anymore on this subreddit I feel like everything is all just editorial and paid youtubers ""CHECK OUT THIS NEW PHONE ZOMG "" ( I hated every second here the flooding of everything by the unexceptional Oneplus Nord).

However I talked at the beginning about the fact of making yourself a little pleasure , a little gift with a new phone and I respect that , we all need something new from time to time and who am I to tell you what to do with your hard earned money ? To hell with that , do whatever you want king ! I get that you find that you want to try that new high refresh rate display , that sweet oled or even the 50X zoom. 

For my part I settled on my Poco F1 and everything looks pretty fine , yes it has that ugly ass notch but I can hide it , the camera is good enough for me , the 4000mah makes it a runner , the snap845 remains still above (ever so slightly) of a good midranger like the 760G, the display is IPS but color accurate and bright , I can live with a 64g model as long as I can get my photos/music/films on an sd card. And that's what pains me the most : nothing makes me go wow , even after 2 years , nothing that would be an undiscutable replacement for that phone. Nothing justifies a phone change anymore",604

&amp;#x200B;

Got a new S10 for under 500 Euro (588,39 Non-Euro but Dollar) and I am impressed so far, its a huge step up from my S6. Anyways I am big into Smart Home, so I thought maybe I can use this to keep my Smartphone Battery happy and healthy (don't over or undercharge it while unsupervised).

&amp;#x200B;

I know Lithium-Ion is already made to not charge fully and so on but please refrain from doing this discussion in the comments all over again...

&amp;#x200B;

So what do u need:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A fitting charger with the right Output for your Phone
2. A working and save Charging cable (I recommend  a magnetic one to also increase the lifespan of the charging-port)
3. Just any TP-Link, Kasa Smart Home Plug (HS100/  KP105...) for 15-20 Euro
4. The IFTT App (free)
5. The Tasker App (4 Euro) or just any App that can notify you of your Phone reaching a certain Percentage in Battery charge via a Notification in the Status-Bar like 'Trigger'
6. ((Bixby optional))

&amp;#x200B;

Bixby can help to avoid some steps, might be able to do this without any other App in the Future...

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the Idea? 

First, the Phone goes below 30 or 20 Percent in Battery Charge.  This Triggers Tasker or your App of choice to display a fitting Notification and this in turn triggers the IFTT App to Turn on or off the Kasa Plug with your Charger in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Bixby at this Point can activate the Plug via the Smart Things App and **without a Hub** when dropping below a certain Percentage in Betterycharge but it can't Trigger Events when above a certain Battery charge, which is truly a missed opportunity...

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it, please write in the comments if you need help or have ideas to improve the cost or processes. Once this all works, it can really take the pressure off the Battery!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: All these Apps might be killed by the Battery management of your Phone so please exclude them from Optimization via the Settings. If you want to keep track of your Battery Health, I recommend the 'AccuBattery' App but there might be better options, if so, please feel free to write them in the comments... Automate Charging, keep Battery between 20% and 80% to increase Lifespan with Kasa Smart Home Plug, IFTT App, and Tasker",384

0,0.95,1491,107,rapphyyy,"I've just finished building a small tool called [symbit]() which helps with rooting and updating of existing rooted devices. With Android 10, some TWRP versions have not been updated to support the new /system partition format and do not work for those devices. This tool aims to solve the issue by making it easier to root and update existing rooted Android devices.

[Source code]()

[README]()

[Download Links]()

My original motivation to create this was when my friend asked me for help updating his Pixel 3 XL. Due to the fact that TWRP does not support Android 10 on the Pixel, I had to tell him to use the manual updating method which involved typing many commands to update the system and patching the  file via Magisk. I decided then to create this small utility to help him and (hopefully) someone else who may have difficulties rooting/updating their rooted device.

In future when I (hopefully) have more time to work on this, it will support running without a PC and directly on Android itself through termux.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! 😉 A tool to help with rooting and updating of Android devices!",191
0,0.88,116,23,azurile57,"At some point several months ago both my and my wife's phone stopped being able to connect to Google Messages for Web. Every time we scanned the QR code to connect it would fail to do so and throw a non-specific error. Googling the problem didn't reveal many answers as most posts are from 2018-2019 and people have success in re-connecting by simply clearing app data/cache, which didn't work for us. 

What did work today was changing the IPv6 DNS server address on our router to a Google DNS server address. It seems that the default DNS server would time-out and fail to resolve the request for some reason. (We moved a few months ago and have a new ISP, presumably the DNS server we connected to changed at that time). 

Hope this helps anyone who has been having a similar problem. PS this may also help if you have trouble connecting your PC to the Microsoft Your Phone Companion app or similar applications. If your phone can't connect to Messages for Web, try changing your DNS server",178

The upcoming standard iPhone 12 is rumored to be 5.4 inches so that's interesting but then again, iOS.

0,0.77,110,126,catalinus,"I do not think it is catastrophically bad but it is definitely something that I dislike and in a way a very anti-competitive move from Samsung, and to fight that the only two options are either some huge regulatory pressure OR maybe we can still use some old free-market pressure and pick something else? It looks like already [Samsung is not doing well this year]() and maybe some extra pressure from buyers would send some message? In some instance we might already be at a point where there is very little choice (for instance with the phones specifically sold by carriers) but other than that what are the good options?

Here is a short list, please feel free to suggest any good alternative!

1) Buy Samsung with Snapdragon from somewhere else - IMHO a bad idea for warranty and to some extent updates, maybe even price but most important very bad for market pressure purpose - if instead of Exynos Samsung we buy Snapdragon Samsung we have sent a pretty bad message and Samsung will laugh at us all the way to the bank. That IMHO is an especially bad example to be set with the Fold 2 but that is another story.

2) Sony Xperia 1 II (and soon Sony Xperia 5 II) - IMHO those are at the very top for somebody that values the headphone jack (and Sony must be commended for listening to the customers on that issue) but unfortunately availability worldwide in general and in Europe in special seems abysmal.

3) Asus Zenfone 7 Pro - just as above availability worldwide in general and in Europe in special seems abysmal.

4) Oneplus 8T/8T Pro - remains to be seen what those will bring, 8 Pro did not impress me personally but Oneplus is the ONLY phone from the entire BBK group (Oneplus, Oppo, Vivo, Realme) that I would somehow consider buying from the software point of view.

5) Xiaomi phones - the Mi 10 Ultra seems interesting but will be China-only and in fact very, very few of the best Xiaomi phones have decent international availability and support - this could improve a little when many carriers seem to move from Huawei to Xiaomi but I would not hold my breath (and generally software updates for Xiaomi are still poor and not something I would recommend for a flagship).

What other options do you think there are in Europe?

EDIT:

I appreciate the idea of a midrange phone but the title of the post was very clear, if your answer is that you probably did not read anything I wrote or you are trolling. Also the naive suggestion of ""buy a midrange"" is in Europe again a significant issue and it again leaves the monopolists like Samsung run laughing at us all the way to the bank.

As someone who uses Notability and Goodnotes on the iPad for note taking it's awesome to see Samsung push that field forward on android with their own Notes app in its latest update.

Digital note taking has honestly changed so much of how I do class work and it's really proven itself to be worth the investment especially now that most of us are stuck at home and have to do assignments and tests remotely.

Combined with small and big things like reduced S Pen latency and DeX, I feel that this goes a long way towards making this particular series of android tablets a legitimate iPad alternative for students who want to use a tablet as a digital hub for most of their class work and as a general use device.

I mean, just Imagine what could be done with Samsung hardware and polishing, and googles smarts and resources. Apple could have a real competitor. Instead they fight and slowly, Apple advances further. They used to be ahead of Apple in almost every category. Now, they’re almost behind in all of them. Apple just grows, while innovation between Samsung and google stops. I don’t think any of the other phones matter right now. Lg is hopelessly behind in brand image, huawai is pretty much dead in the us, and any other manufacturer that’s not Chinese or these companies doesn’t have the resources to really capture more of the market. Just to top it off, the losses for the loosing company are immense. 

If Samsung wins:

- Google could lose up to 60% of its market share. This could decimate Android. 
- This could also be the end of Samsung, as unless they can make something in house that’s good, this could be a repeat of bada os. 

If google wins: 

- Samsung would lose it’s os. Let’s face it, bada os failed. They’re just not good at wowing devs and consumers. 
- Googles android division could be dead, as 60% of android phones could become something else.

Then we were hit with the audio skipping issue at exactly 1 min 50 seconds. Nothing would fix it, not factory resetting or bluetooth cache deleting or left bud first, etc.

Called Google for a refund and they didn't even push an exchange, they just said ""yeah ok so I can process the refund for you"".

It's kind of disappointing that this is such a wide-spread issue (a LOT of threads on reddit and other sites show this) with a product that costs so much. I've had much better/stable connection with 20-30 dollar buds.

0,0.9,165,484,punchoutlanddragons,"Thought I'd get this post gong as I've just gotten a new phone and moved away from my two year long nightmare phone. It was a Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium and though on paper it was a decent phone in real life it was god awful.

I had previously owned a Sony Xperia Z3 from 2015 to 2016 before moving to a Galaxy S7 up until late 2018. I will shoulder some of the blame as I decided I'd wanted to use a big phone but my god was that a mistake, which is why I got the XZ2P. That thing was a massive chonky boi. One handed use was impossible. Using my phone lying down caused massive arm cramps and with almost a quarter kg of phone I'm sure I gave myself a concussion every time I dropped it on my face.

The size was a big part of the unusability for me but the user was experience and software was what really made it horrendous. Two years and three android versions later there was still no gesture navigation (which probably would have made using the phone easier) or face unlock, and I only just got system wide dark mode in April. The software was essentially stock android packed with Sony bloat with very little added in the way of user experience. I was baffled coming from my S7 as why screenshots didn't immediately allow for cropping or to go into scrolling capture mode? Why was there no screen recording, a feature that was on Z3 3 years earlier? Network interaction with my sim card was horrendous as well as after ages talking to multiple customer service places I found out that the thickness of the phone affected signal quality indoors and with no WiFi calling it meant people would try to call me and get a dead line alot. Horrendous app optimisation was also infuriating. There was a one in 5 chance that playing a song on Spotify would cause my phone to freeze for 5 mins then restart and plenty of games that should have been light work for the phones SD845 processor would run like utter shit because it clearly wasn't made with game performance in mind.

0,0.56,6,34,PalmTreeExpert,"So I wanted to setup this post to have as sort of a discussion and gather others opinions on the potential (and most likely) Pixel 5 from google. I also wanted to state that I am currently using a Pixel 4 myself (and wanted to discuss my disappointments.)

&amp;#x200B;

Since the release of the pixel they have had 2 defining features. The stock Android experience, and arguably the best camera upon release each generation. They have never toted the best specs, and sometimes even left out some newer hardware, but the camera gave it a reason to be used. Now with leaks surrounding the Pixel 5 it looks like they will be downgrading the specs, and rather than at least having flagship level processors it is obvious that they are moving away from that. Leaks also highly speculate at a plastic back, a back mounted finger print scanner (I personally grew to like face unlock, but am disappointed in not at least having an in screen!), and with these being out of the picture I would not be surprised at a lack of wireless charging. These all seem like a MASSIVE downgrade from the past products offered. However, none of this stacks up to the letdown that the cameras will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Rumors are agreeing that they will stay with the same camera hardware that they have been using since the Pixel 2, a massive disappointment. With what Google has achieved through software imagine the insane potential they have if they now upgraded the hardware and paired it with the software! On top of this, by downgrading the processor there is no way that the software can work it's magic as well as the pixel 4, and with the pixel 4 having guaranteed updates for 2 more years it should outperform. In addition to this supposedly they will take away the telephoto lens, and replace it with an ultra wide. I am all for an ultra wide, but it is time that google has a triple camera setup and ADDS the ultra wide, not replace the telephoto with it. With all the camera rumors coming around it seems like one of the only 2 reasons to buy a Pixel device, and arguably the biggest reason, is now dead.

&amp;#x200B;

If these current rumors turn to be true upon release I will personally not be getting a new device from Google. I am honestly fine with a mid range processor, but the letdown of a premium design and hardware, as well as the catastrophic letdown of the cameras lead there to be little reason to desire a Pixel device. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely want to have a discussion to see what peoples opinions are if the Pixel 5 matches these rumors. What do you think makes it a considerable device, what are you personally disappointed in, and current Pixel 4 owners would you consider upgrading - (downgrading?) - ? With rumors surrounding an upcoming Pixel 5, what is there actually in the device to actually entice a purchase over any other phone?",503

Should have Samsung lowered the price as well? And if yes, by how much? Shouldn't we be glad that the Samsung Exynos exists?",124

I'm currently using my ancient Honor 9 and all I'm worried about is if I get used to a bigger phone once I upgrade.

Does Apple pays Instagram to do this? Is this legal?

Why Does smartphone reviewers like /u/Marques-Brownlee , /u/ThisIsTechToday , UnboxTherapy never talk about this?

If is not illegal and it is not a disloyal, unfair action, why Google doesn't do the same for YouTube? Like deliberately lowers the quality of whatever it is uploaded from an iPhone or any other Apple product?

Here is a link of an article written in spanish that made some tests to prove what I’m saying.

[]()

Basically, doesn't matter what you use to shoot a video, even if you use a Red Camera, or a Canon DSLR, even if you shoot your videos on an iPhone! if you upload that video using an Android it will look like garbage, if you upload exactly the same video using iPhone it will look crystal clear.

Tik Tok for example doesn't do this, and the overall quality of the app looks a lot much better than Instagram because of the same reason, Android and Apple users can upload crystal clear videos if they have a good camera.

Why nobody is complaining? I love pixel phones, and I love the camera picture style, but there is no sense on having this quality if I can not share it with anyone.

If this was fixed a lot of people, influencers, and creatives will be able to switch to Android.

“Happiness is only real, when shared""

EDIT: 
Please be aware that I'm not talking about recording video with the integrated camera app, I understand all the hardware variations that this involves and how hard it can be to achieve homogeneous results. I'm talking about uploading a video recorded with another app or device, using the app only as an uploader, shouldn't produce different results as the compression happens server side using the same version of x264 library.

EDIT2:
Someone suggested to use Instander, an instagram mod which can manipulate some flags inside the app, one of this flags is able to override the video upload quality bitrate, I try this with the suggested value of 10mb, and it really worked, the uploaded result looks a lot more sharper  I will try a higher bitrate to see how hi can I go up, this also proves that it is just a setting and not a hardware variation in smartphones what is causing this as a lot of people suggest. I understand some phones might struggle with higher bitrates, but instagram could at least try higher values for latest processor chips, and not just put one low setting for everybody.

Another tool that yield interesting results was Inssist a chrome instagram client extension, you can upload stories and videos directly from your computer, however I found that this videos had to be carefully crafted, with a bitrate not very high so instagram don't compress them a lot, and not so low so they don't look ugly, in my tests using ffmpeg to encode the videos before uploading with a CRF of 20 or a 12mb VBR(6457k) yield very good results depending on the duration and darkness of the videos.

0,0.47,0,103,web-developer-ba,"Typical question is like: does my phone supports HDMI cable connection? Is there a way / adapter which allows to connect my phone to TV using a HDMI cable?

And the typical answer is: no. Your phone doesn't have USB 3.1, just USB 2.0, so you have to use only the Chromecast (wireless) adapter.

Especially the Xiaomi community here is full of these wrong answers, as most of Xiaomi phones does have the USB 2.0 interface only.

But the truth is: ALMOST ALL Android devices, phones or tablets, is possible to connect to TV through a HDMI cable. Just with another kind of adapter...

To be more specific: if your phone / tablet

1. runs Android 5 (Lollipop) or newer,
2. does have the USB 2.0 interface - no matter the connector, Micro USB or USB-C,
3. and supports the OTG,

then there is almost 100% probability you can connect your phone to TV using the particular HDMI adapter and HDMI cable, and Chromecast is definitely not your only option.

So, as these three requirements meets almost all phones and tablets sold nowadays, most answers here is simply wrong. Or ... not fully correct, at least.

EDIT: DisplayLink is the name of this another solution. But there is a catch. And unfortunately, not the only one. So I started working on a complete video how-to. In which I demonstrate, explain and test this solution. I will use three different phones:

1. Cheap Xiaomi Redmi 9A with Micro USB port. Mainly because I found a opinion in a comments that you have no possibility to connect a phone with Micro USB port to HDMI. Ok, let's see.
2. Mid class Redmi Note 9 Pro. Just because it is a typical, popular model, with good price / performance ratio.
3. And the top model Pocophone Poco F2 Pro 8GB (LPDDR5) RAM.

I will test these phones with two different HDMI adapters, based on two different chipsets. And I will test every combination at least with YouTube, Netflix, and Call of Duty Mobile. I think it will address most of questions around the Android phones and HDMI cable connection possibility / functionality...

PS: Yes, I know you read on internet that Neflix doesn't work through DisplayLink. But I say that's not true either. There is a way also for Netflix.

PPS: So, as I read the comments, I clearly can't emhasise enough the fact I'm talking just about A WAY.

ChromeCast is one of that ways. ChromeCast is a wireless adapter which allows to mirror your phone screen to TV. This (wireless) way / adapter comes with own pros and cons. One of pros is that it is wireless. One of cons is that it is ... wireless; so it needs wireless router to connect to, and the picture does have so big delay, that it is unusable to play the games with.

As another solution you can consider the DisplayLink adapter. It also comes with it's own pros and cons. Cons can be, for example, that it is a bit pricey (very subjective), or the picture resolution is limited up to FullHD - 1920x1080 pixels. Or that this is not a native solution. I know.

All I say that this is just another solution and that it is not very well known solution. But works. With it's own limitations, but works too.

And finally, all I wants to do for you, is to test this solution and make a video in which you find answers to your (repeating) questions: what is the picture quality? What's the delay? What about tearing? Most answers here, about HDMI support, is wrong.",586

While having a large number of megapixels is great for marketing, it results in tiny photosites and hurts low light performance.

Pixel binning, while great in theory, is not efficient enough in real world usage.

If Samsung had instead chose 12mp instead of 108mp for its 1/1.33"" sensor, it would get similar image quality to an rx100 cropped down from 20mp to 12mp.

I noticed that iPhone has easier camera app to uss but also much more limited. Here is my comparison. 


Main Camera-iPhone takes more realistic colors but on the other hand P30 Pro captures more detail in certain conditions. It comes down to personal preference if you like realistic colors on iPhone or the ones on Huawei better.iPhone handles artifacts better aswell but P30 Pro has better autofocus. I give slight edge to iPhone in this one

Telephoto Camera-Huawei is clear winner here. It has unreal capabilities and despite being released year and a half ago its still great in that department not only holding up to but beating some of the 2020 flagships. It offers amazing 5x optical zoom and 10x hybrid aswell as 50x digital compared to Apples 2x optical and 10 digital. Agaim, clear winner is Huawei P30 Pro. 


Ultrawide-iPhone has better colors and bigger field of view but there is more noise and some deformation at the edges. On the other hand Huawei P30 Pro has good exposure good detail tho unnatural detail rendering appears in some shots and it can be inconsistent with colors it generally captures more detail and has less noise. I would call this one a draw but if i had to choose winner i think slight edge goes to iPhone 11 Pro Max because of wider field of view. 


Portrait/Bokeh-Okay this is where I think iPhone is terrible despite ""reviews"" including even the mighty DxOmark giving it a fairly good grades. Whenever I tried to take portrait shot on iPhone, it came out terrible compared to Huawei P30 Pro. Inside of between my arm and torso is never blured so If i want to avoid that I had to pin my arms to my body or not take portrait shot but a regular one. It also struggles around edges especially on hair. On the other hand only thing you can complain about on P30 Pro is somewhat unnatural skin tone. Other than that amazing edges and ovarall much better shots than iPhone including detail on my clothes alot of times. Winner is clearly Huawei P30 Pro. 


Night-Another overrated aspect of iPhones camera. If you want to take quick photo in dark of someone or something you can't. It needs night mode to take photos in dark while Huawei P30 Pro does just good even with night mode off using auto mode. However when we do turn on night mode, again iPhone produces more realistic colors but Huawei captures more detail. If we go darker than well lit situation with street lights and stuff iPhone performs terribly while Huawei maintains alot of detail and brightens up the photo somehow. Also if you want to zoom in on iPhone you don't use telephoto camera instead it crops and uses digital zoom, thats why you can't zoom out to use ultrawide with night mode on. You can do that on Huawei P30 Pro. This one goes to Huawei too, by a considerable margin. 


Video-iPhone produces better colors generally with better stabilisation.It can also record in 60 fps at 4k while P30 can't go past 30fps.iPhone wins this one, tho video with ultrawide imo is better on P30 Pro. Still iPhone 11 Pro Max wins comftorably. 


Extra modes and features
iPhone 11 Pro Max really lacks alot conpared to Huawei P30 Pro and thats a huge minus in this comparison aswell and something that really sets P30 Pro apart. Here are all the great modes/features iPhone lacks compared to Huawei:
Macro Mode
Aperture Mode
Master AI
Pro Mode
Underwater Mode
RAW Format


All of these are useful things to have that iPhone decided to ignore. Also none of these are rated on DxOmark... Some phones have whole lens dedicated to macro shots and DxOmark ignores it. There is alot of things DxOmark doesn't analize that it should and I think their grades shouldn't be taken too seriously because even their grades are off quite often and have alot of unrealistic grades. 


So anyways that is what I noticed from my exoerience. I think Huawei P30 Pro wins this one tho for some users it doesn't matter because they only use main camera and portrait and front camera which is something both phones do grest job of like pretty much 98% of flagships since 2019 out there and to those people small things and details won't really matter so its a thing of ppreference.

The very popular custom ROM named ""CyanogenMod"" offered more stability and regular updates(there were other good roms too). It was not perfect, but it has less bugs compared to stock.

But fast forward on 2017 and beyond. The flashing community became less.  
Some people believe that flashing a custom ROM is not anymore necessary, because stock ROM is already good enough for a daily driver. Hardware is getting more battery efficient and powerful too.  


I have some friends back on my college that no longer flashes custom ROM. They were flashaholics and flash ROMs during classes.  
They said its good enough and they don't want further customizations/features.  


I got a Redmi K20 Pro last year. For almost a year, I have remained on stock MIUI.  
Even if I was a custom ROM addict before, for sometime, I forgot that custom ROMs exist for almost a year, because stock was enough and sufficient for my daily needs.  


Until a month ago, I wanted to bring back nostalgic memories of my past. When I was still using a Galaxy S4, flashing custom ROMs everyday.  


So I browsed XDA forums to flash a ROM, and found out that there is still a lot of people into this type of stuff. I got bored of MIUI so i wanted to try another thing.  
Custom ROMs are not dead. Phones like Xiaomi and OnePlus has a strong developer community support. This tradition must not perish. Custom ROMs are not dead, stock ROM just got better these days.",298

Applications like Fiverr, Audible, AliExpress, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram X, Twitch, Twitter, TikTok, Viber, Xbox, and so on.

It's understandable that application can ""write"" to the system clipboard (there are buttons to copy links, for example). Other apps, like Word, have their own ""paste"" button.

But for plenty of others, why do they need to read the clipboard?

Isn't it a clear intrusion into privacy? Users do copy passwords from their password manager, or private information from private chats.

And some applications, like Instagram, even access ""usage statistics"".

The majority of OLED screens will start getting burn in after about 2 years (even if you are conscious about them and take special care of them, which is a pain in the ass). Most phones' warranties end after 2 years so your only option will be to replace it and OLED screens are very expensive, so replacing your phone will make more sense then. An IPS screen is better than an OLED with burn in 3 or 4 years down the line, and even if you happen to damage it, you can replace it on the cheap.

Inspired by [this topic](), as I wanted to argue the usefulness almost every feature mentioned there but decided to make a post rather than a dozen comments. We are all different and have different needs anyway.

So I got a Note 9 recently. It's not the phone I'd buy for myself, but my phone died and my girlfriend gave me her Note. Overall it's nice (though I'd love it much MUCH more if it was 5-5.5"") but I noticed that I dislike or don't care about most features people love it for. In my case these features are:

* Fingerprint reader. This is something I could definitely live without. I've had phones with side readers (okay), front readers (so-so) and back readers (from meh to shit). I have to turn my phone over and look for the reader if I want to use it because it's poorly located (next to the camera and not where my index finger goes when I'm using the phone with one hand). Thankfully Note 9 has face/eye unlock, but if it didn't I'd still prefer pattern unlock over the fingerprint reader like I did on my previous phones. Oh and I tried the fingerprint gestures but it resulted mostly in accidental swipes, and on the Note 9 having to look for the reader (so that you don't try swiping on the camera) ruins the feature completely. Anyway Smart Lock makes all the unlocking features less important (now this is a good example of an underrated feature).

* Gesture navigation. I was stoked about it, I tried all the unofficial options (XDA navigation, FNG) and all the official ones, yet I keep coming back to the nav buttons. I really dislike the nav buttons and I welcomed the change unless I tried it out and just couldn't get used to it. Here I will sing praise to Samsung and its Goodlock: NavStar lets you move the buttons to the right for one-handed use. Without this option I'd surely prefer gestures on a phablet like this.

* Voice assistants. I still haven't found any use for Google Assistant besides ""remind me to paint the walls pink tomorrow at nine am"", which is neat but not very useful. It doesn't integrate well with third-party apps that well (being able to seamlessly use it with Todoist would have changed my opionion... perhaps).

* Wireless charging. I have a pad at home but I'd easily give it up. It's extremely useful to people like my gf who forgets to charge her phone otherwise, but it's definitely not a game changer to those who are a bit more organized.

* Always on display. I loved it on dumbphones and early smartphones, but can't get used to it on an OLED screen. Every time I see it I try to turn the screen off only to discover that it was off already. I guess it's more useful if you don't have a smartwatch though.

* The Bixby button. Of course I love the idea of a customizable button, setting up BxActions was one of the first things I did after getting this phone. However so far most of my keypresses were accidental. I guess the location of this button is great if you use the phone with two hands, but I only switch to two hands when I take the S-Pen out. The volume buttons location also sucks for one-handed use btw.

* Samsung Edge Panel. Same, it sounds like a good idea but 90% of time it was accidental wherever I put it. Actually a lot of One UI features like pop-up view sound nice but I can't find any real use for them.

* Telephoto. It may be handy sometimes (though I haven't needed it yet in 1.5 months since receiving the phone) but a superwide would have been way more useful.

* Headphone jack. I still use wired headphones sometimes, and I've used the line in for recording sound but I did the same on my previous phone without the jack and the only ""inconvenience"" was having to use an adaptor. It's nice to have the jack but it's definitely not the hill to die on for me.

* NFC. I think the amount of phones with NFC I've had exceeds the amount of times I've used it. I know you can use it for public transportation or payments in many countries but I don't live in such a country so it's useless to me. I was excited about NFC tags back in 2012 when I got my first phone with NFC but I still haven't come up with a use case for them in the following years.

* OLED screen. Yes, it's nice. But frankly I don't care. I don't care about Pentile and PWM, neither do I care about OLED blacks. I don't know what black smear is, my screen looks and works great (no burn-in so far), the IPS screens I had before looked and worked great as well. Oh and I run it at FHD+ resolution because that looks good enough and I see no reason to use WQHD+.

I guess this post makes me look like some kind of a ""get off my lawn"" guy but actually I'm always happy to embrace the innovations, it's just that most of them end up landing somewhere between ""okay"" and ""meh"". I loved the useful ones: One UI is great (ugly tho) and the S-Pen is absolutely amazing (literally the only thing that makes its size justified, but I'd still like it to be 5-5.5""). I can't say anything about the hyped features I haven't tried (like the high refresh screen).

0,0.95,122,53,hurrahurrahurra,"Hi all,

I've been looking around for VPNs on mobile since I'm travelling these days and have stumbled over the emerging decentralized VPN approaches I found interesting. Two of those would be [Tachyon]() or [Orchid](). This post is about Tachyon.

Since VPNs can easily be an attack vector, I was doing a bit of research but only found a few conclusive reviews about Tachyon (besides prominent[ hype articles]()). Nothing too bad neither but usually just [some doubt]() in the independent reviews I've seen. They seem to have a rapidly growing userbase though and quite a few downloads on Google Play Store (500k+). They do offer a [GitHub repo]() which I sifted through but didn't find comprehensive at first glance. I'm not qualified to judge the code though.

But what really raised my suspicion was that their [official subreddit]() seems to be very ingenuine. The posts are your standard advertising, which is fair. But the comments, so I'm convinced, are altogether posted by bots. All comments share the same one- or two-sentence structure, are all very positive, don't interact, and come from people who's post history only consists of hyping some bitcoin stuff.

If you compare it to other subreddits of apps that could potentially pose some security threat like [YouTube Vanced]() (for being an out-of-Play-Store-App), the difference is striking. You'll find some genuine discussions there.

So why would a genuine app that's built on trust and is as security-sensitive as a VPN find themselves with such a subreddit? It certainly raised my suspicion - if you have got any (opposing?) information about Tachyon VPN I'd be happy to hear about it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The official Tachyon VPN subreddit consists of bots. I wouldn't trust that app.

Edit: /u/Rhea-Tachyon has come back with a [reply](;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I've linked it here since the downvotes pushed it below the visibility threshold. PSA: Tachyon VPN appears to be a scam",307

And especially on Android, we as users have been spoiled not to accept ""new version, new payment"" like we do in other platforms.

I have a few apps that I'm happy to pay a direct subscription/Patreon for (AutoApps &amp; Tasker &lt;3). But I was wondering about other, non-essential but still useful apps. Generally speaking if there's a free version w/ads available I install that and use it for a while, and if I find it useful I pay for the full version if available. But I'm left wondering if developers would just rather I keep using it w/ads instead of paying one-time. Of course this is not a new question, but now Play Pass is in the game as well.

Initially I was going to make this only a ""free w/ads vs. Play Pass"" thread, but if there are cases of developers preferring a one-time payment or users preferring direct subscriptions I would like to hear it too.

Since Samsung doesn't currently have an official keyboard case for it, I went with the [Fintie Keyboard Case]() from Amazon.

Unfortunately, I don't find it to be ergonomic at all. While it functions fine for the 2-in-1 keyboard purpose, if I just want to browse it like a tablet it's woefully inconvenient. It's heavier than my other case and the fold itself wants to misalign while I'm holding it. Both of these cause problems for browsing.

When I learned how the magnets worked, I came up with a solution. Now I'm using the former case with the keyboard from the latter. While it won't fold with the keyboard and tablet inside the case, I can attach the keyboard to the top or bottom of the case's exterior. I can simply remove the keyboard when I'm not using it and return to browsing on my more comfortable Samsung case. If I want to take them with me, I simply magnetize the keyboard to the exterior. 



I've learned the best of both worlds right here. Hope this can be of help to someone. Decided to try something with two cases and a keyboard. [Galaxy Tab S6 Lite]",225

Coming from flagships only, I was very nervous about the build quality and performance.

The build quality is way better than I expected. It feels very light, as expected, but dense and solid, and not cheap at all. This has the least flimsy, least wiggly buttons of any generation of Pixel device. They are rock solid, and very clicky. I think this is my favorite Pixel so far in terms of hardware. The speakers are a lot better than expected, and I have no complaints with them. Some reviewers talked about imbalance between the two speakers, but I don't experience that.

Performance so far has been great. It feels like a Pixel. There's been no stutter or lag, and while I'm sure you can make it, normal use has not. I've seen a few reviewers mention poor performance, and only ever using flagships made me expect the worst. Hearthstone runs perfectly, so gaming performance is good enough for me. Even touch latency feels great (unlike even the S20 Ultra I owned for a bit).

The screen isn't great. It does get very bright, much brighter than any other Pixel in direct sunlight, and the DPI is perfectly good. But there is a weird faint, shimmery, rainbow look to the display, and when looking at a white screen, the top center has a yellow tint to it. It's far from a bad display, but it's clearly a step down from a flagship.

Haptics are the other weak point that I've found. They just don't feel good at all. Very similar to Samsung, where they are trying to make ""clicks"" and ""thuds"", but you can very much still feel the vibration buzz instead. A big step down from the Pixel 3 and 4, and nowhere close to an iPhone.

I've owned every generation of Nexus and Pixel, and like any sane person, fondly remember the Nexus 5. It was the last time I spent $350 on a phone. The Pixel 4a feels like that phone did, and I'm positive it's going to be remembered in the same way. It makes the right compromises for the price, feels great for the price, and makes you question why other phones cost so much more. Barring any of Google's famous defects and QA disasters, I think this is an amazing phone, and would still be worth it at quite a bit more money.

0,0.42,0,106,tekreviews,"I've now had the pleasure of using the tab S7+ for the past 3 days (thanks to a colleague who had an early review unit), and although it's inevitable that I'll be comparing it to my iPad Pro since it's the tab's direct competitor, and the one to beat--this still is an important moment, and turning point for Android tablets as a whole. Other OEMs, take notes.  

# Hardware:

Holding it, the S7+ is very thin/light, and very enjoyable to carry around. The build quality is extremely solid resembling my iPad Pro (as well as its design). Although the cameras aren't at the same level, they're still good and will do video calling no problem. I'm also surprised at how good the speakers are. To me, they sound just as good as Apple's. However, one noticeable area that I thought could've been better is the log-in metric. I love fingerprint readers on phones--they're fast and reliable, but I really do prefer Face ID much more here since it's more convenient to use, and more secure (especially given the whole in-display fingerprint scandal Samsung had). S-Pen charging is also a bit awkward and not as convenient as the way Apple does it.

The SD 865+ is also a very capable chip, and for the vast majority of apps it's more than enough; however, I did still experience noticeable choppiness in games (like pubg and TFT) and certain apps (like artflow and adobe illustrator) compared to the A12X in my iPad Pro, which I guess was to be expected. The S7+ also got hotter quicker than my iPad Pro, and overall stayed hotter longer as well. I believe this is partly due to the 865+ needing to work harder, but also possible a difference in app optimization. 

At around 350 nits with 120 hertz enabled, I got 5 hours on the tab, and 6 hours on my 12.9"" iPad Pro. 

# Display:

The 120 hertz OLED is beautiful. Gorgeous. Stunning...  you can see the picture, that is. What I mean by this is that the max brightness only goes up to 420 nits on the S7+, which on a monitor would be more than fine, but smaller devices needs to be brighter to achieve the same effect. The tab is perfectly ok when using it at night--with little lights on--but during the morning, noon, afternoon, even when I cranked it up to max brightness I still have trouble seeing my screen. It's also much more glossy than my iPad Pro--so that doesn't help, and for reference, the iPad Pro's peak brightness is 600 nits. That's 30% brighter! OLED doesn't mean anything if you can't see the contrast difference Samsung!  

Edit: Forgot about this, but I also found the 120 hertz to be pretty pointless for gaming since you can’t hit nor sustain 120 FPS on a tablet with games like pubg etc with the SD 865+. It’s only possible for the iPad Pro because it has the A12X. A lot of games also doesn’t support 120 FPS to begin with, but it is very smooth and satisfying to scroll through apps. 

Edit: People seem to think I said the screen is worse. Yes, it is when you’re using it next to a window or in a lit area, but the tab’s undoubtedly better. However, my argument was you won’t be able to see your screen much during the day (next to a window or outside) since it’s not bright enough. At night, the tab is better.

The update to 9ms latency on the S-PEN is very welcomed. I can see and feel the difference, and it's great. I've been drawing for the past 10 years, and have used many wacom tablets; I would say the S-PEN is better than wacom pens (because of the latency), but falls short of the Apple pencil. In terms of pure sketching (not including app support), I would say the S7+ is slightly better than wacom tablets due to its upgraded latency and 120 hertz (since it uses the same pressure sensitivity as wacom), but not as good as the iPad Pro. Here's why: 

The smaller tip on the S-PEN is not necessarily a good thing when it comes to drawing and sketching. People who draw want broader angles (less compact like the smaller tip but more elongated) because you have more angles and freedom for shading and sketching, and is also easier to draw longer lines. Refer to this [video.]() The S-PEN is more like the tri-pod grip but fails when you try to draw lines with the under-hand grip. Whereas the Apple Pencil excels at both, while maintaining the same detail quality as its pointier counterpart. 

The S-PEN also has more line-jitters when you draw, leading to an overall worse experience. App support is also a very important factor. Yes, Android has Artflow and other apps, but they're nowhere near as good as Procreate. Of course wacom is still the best for pro-workflows that heavily rely on app feature set (like animation and Photoshop), but for pure sketching/drawing purposes the iPad Pro is still the best in this regard.   

# Software:

Android on tablet has been getting better over the years, but the reality is it's still not as robust as iPadOS. A lot of pro apps like pro-create, affinity designer, lumafusion, flow, etc simply aren't available on Android. The apps that are available are a step-down compared to its iPadOS counterpart due to lazy optimization, and to add insult to injury, Apple's software support is just much better. You can expect them to support your iPad Pro for a minimum of 5 years and probably more since the A12X is so powerful and future-proof. Although 3 years from Samsung is a good start, it just doesn't make sense to me why someone *wouldn't* spend more to get a better drawing experience, battery life, SoC, longevity, and app ecosystem (unless you're on a budget of course). 

And as amazing as Dex is (better multi-tasking and files system although I’m not too sure about 6GB ram while in Dex), it can't replace a laptop due the lack of apps--it'll probably be far better if you just bought a laptop at that point, or a 2-in-1 that comes with much better hardware, and windows--like the HP ENVY x360 (Ryzen 4700U) that's actually cheaper, but better in every area. If you're only looking to use the S7+ as a tablet/take notes on the side, then the $850+potential keyboard is way too much for what you're getting especially since you can just get a $300 iPad+Apple pencil for half the price. Or, again, you can just get the HP ENVY x360! If you're an artist who wants a tablet to draw on, then the iPad Pro is simply the better product because of the robust apps and drawing experience I explained before. 

# Conclusion:

As you can see, this puts the 7+ in a very awkward position. The iPad Pro has the better apps and drawing experience for artists and designers; the S7+ can't compete with the base iPad pricing for most people that just wants a tablet, or for school, and too expensive and offers too little to compete with laptops and 2-in-1s. It's definitely cheaper than the iPad Pro that it's targeting, but the things you're giving up (like app ecosystem, brighter/less glossy screen, better processor, battery life, and software support) is not worth it in my opinion. 

What Samsung should've done was made a tablet to compete with the Air. Take out the 120 hertz from the 11"" model and switch it with a SD 855 and price it at $400 with a free pen. It would sell like hotcakes. People who want a tablet for media consumption and school (which doesn't rely on app variety since most mainstream media apps are well-optimized) would look at the tab and say ""It looks more futurist, comes with a pen that I can take notes with, and is $100 cheaper than the Air? I'm in!""  

However, Samsung is in luck because Apple decided it's Apple and can price its accessories as much as it wants. SO in total, a 12.9"" iPad Pro+Apple Pencil 2+Magic Keyboard will cost you **$1480!!!** In contrast, the same combo with the tab will cost you $400 less at **$1080.** Now personally I would still pay the $1480 since the Magic keyboard is just so convenient to take off and use from tablet mode to keyboard mode, along with all the other features mentioned before, but I can see how an average consumer will look at both choices and pick the tab over the iPad Pro.

Or you know, just get an [HP ENVY x360]() that comes with a freaking **RYZEN 4700U** at $820 with a free pen... It has all the things someone would want from a tablet—touchscreen, pro apps, great build quality, can take notes and be flipped like a tablet for media, and has way more powerful hardware.

First: Pixels don't have shutter lag because they are already recording photos before you press the shutter. Shutter lag is defined as the delay between pressing the shutter and capture.

Second: Pixels capture multiple images at higher shutter speeds, breaks then into tiles, and then aligns them. This allows them to deal with subject motion better than any other phone camera.

And While both displays look phenomenal, the main difference between those two displays is that the S20 Ultra is more vibrant and can produce 16M colors (8-bit color) while the 8 Pro is more color accurate and can produce 1B colors (10-bit color), which means that the colors can also produce more details. So you would expect the 8 Pro to look better than the S20 Ultra right? Well... yes &amp; no. While it's true that the 8 Pro does have better accurate and detailed colors, it also suffers from black crush that a lot of users have reported on that phone unlike the S20 Ultra. And as a result, the S20 Ultra's display is brighter and more clear than the 8 Pro. Especially if you go to the 3:13 mark, the difference is night &amp; day.

Anyway, I was thinking about those phones today and thought, man, if there was a 2020 Samsung or LG or any other top brand that came loaded with stock Android, I would definitely consider buying one. But only if they were offered for sale on the Google Store (or another marketplace that allowed me to finance it at 0%). Back in 2013, they were expensive and there wasn't really a way to finance the hefty price tag. I think that's probably the main reason it didn't catch on.

Then I tried it with my old trusty Galaxy S9+ and viola! It worked perfectly! Initially, it started to auto-launch Samsung DeX, but I just had to switch to screen mirroring with a single tap. The latency was almost nonexistent, and the picture quality was as crisp as it could get.

The best part, however, was how it allows you to pick an audio output source from your phone! This is a surprisingly rare feature. For example, if I connect my PS4 to my monitor, I am forced to hook up an external speaker to my monitor since most monitors do not support audio. On Galaxy phones, however, Samsung has a special [media control option]() under the notification shade that allows you to use your own phone's speaker (or Bluetooth devices) for audio. I never realized how much of a neat feature that was. You could even output from up to 2 separate Bluetooth speakers at once, a feature I have not yet found on any other phones.

0,0.4,0,50,corbinado,"The Experiment -
I've used Android for 8 years and more specifically Google's Nexus and Pixel lines beginning with the launch of the 6P and purchasing every phone at launch up to the latest Pixel 4 XL. After many frustrations with Google's seemed lack of direction and sorrow at the loss of Google Play Music amongst  which I've been using for over 5 years and other apps I decided to do the unthinkable - try an iPhone to see which company would earn my business for the future. 

The Person - 
Male, 26-year old, lover of tech, small-business owner heavily reliant on phone for vendor, employee &amp; work-related tools like spreadsheets, documents, cloud storage &amp; more throughout the day. Average work day 9AM-8PM M-Sa.

iPhone - 
I purchased a used iPhone 11 Pro Max 64gb August 1st 2020 ($750) 

Pixel -  
Pixel 4 XL 64gb, purchased new October 2019 ($900) and my Fossil Watch Sport, purchased new July 2019 ($200). 

Accessories - 
Pixel Buds 2 used with both devices, purchased new June 2020 ($180). 
Apple Watch Series 5 44mm ($320)
Fossil Watch Sport ($200)

Note: I purchased used Apple products for sake of ‘apples to apples’ degradation comparisons. 

The Goal -
To compare &amp; contrast Apple's iPhone with Google's Pixel 4 XL. We'll be comparing software, hardware &amp; accessories to see which company offers the best smartphone option. 

Software - 
Google Advantages:
• At A Glance' widget on home page
• Google's call/contacts app &amp; ability to search &amp; call businesses inside it is underrated.
• Google search bar accessibility
• Home-Screen customization
• Ability to swipe on either side of the screen to go back
• Ability to text from any computer
• Quick settings edits from dropdown notification bar
• Always on display
• Default placement of 'new message/call/item' in bottom right vs. top right
• Master volume controls
• Call &amp; Message bubbles
• Google Assistant &gt; Siri

Apple Advantages:
• Strong native apps, fantastic integration of native apps throughout OS
• iMessage is leaps ahead of RTC
• Overall refinement in apps is higher due to more oversight &amp; requirements on developers
• Dark mode carries throughout apps more seamlessly
• Google's own app suite is available on iOS and is easy to begin utilizing. The UI on Google apps is easier to work with in iOS than in Android (best example - Chrome. Tab management &amp; settings accessibility are better).
• Less glitches &amp; quirks during everyday use
• Third parties tend to have more features &amp; options for iOS

Hardware - 
Google Advantages:
• After thinking about this for a while I really couldn't find any advantages to their hardware.

Apple Advantages:
• In-house development/oversight on more components
• Absolutely incredible battery life.
• Very fast processing, does not seem to slow down
• No issues with overheating in hot sun

Accessories - 
Google Advantages:
• Fantastic wireless charging stand (Pixel Stand)
• Pixel Buds 2 genuinely comfy and great sound, fantastic integration with Google Assistant

Apple Advantages:
• Apple Watch is years ahead of any Wear OS watch. I can't get over just how good it really is
• Airpods deliver strong sound, mic feedback &amp; noise cancellation
• Uniform look to products &amp; functionality

Camera &amp; Video - 
Google Advantages:
• Tech behind the camera provides insane images without having the crazy lenses of other phones

Apple Advantages:
• Consistently snappy photos
• Video is far better on iOS with their 60fps 4k video
• Native photo effects &amp; editing has more options
• Triple lense options allows for more versatility

The Winner - 
User preference. Both systems are great in their own ways and at this stage are incredibly similar. Both have pros and cons. 

If I picked today which one I would be daily driving, it would be the iPhone. Clear direction of development, reliability, strong hardware &amp; a plethora of software that works seamlessly together coupled with Google's own support of iOS with virtually their entire software suite allow the iPhone to function off of my favorite Google products while still providing the Apple experience and benefits as well. The convenience features that the Pixel offers are lovely but replaceable and the processing power and battery life are enough to keep the iPhone running smoothly for the entire day. 8 year Android User Tries iPhone for 2 Weeks",684

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

For those, like me, who get frustrated with delayed Gmail notifications on their non-rooted devices (linked to doze mode AND Google decision to consider emails with ""Unkwown priority""), I've setup a script with Automate. This script could probably be improved in reliability, but so far so good.

The principle is to catch a specific message from the Android Events Log indicating activity on the Gmail account, and force a synchronization. Incoming message will be downloaded to the device and notification will pop up.

To do so:

\- download on your device Automate (a Tasker-like). Free version is ok for this script: []()

\- grant Automate to read logs with the ADB command (see here: []())  
adb -s &lt;serial number&gt; shell pm grant com.llamalab.automate android.permission.READ\_LOGS

\- open the app, and on the menu, select ""Community"", and search ""NO ROOT !! Gmail instant notification"". Download the script.

\- type your gmail email address on the block #3.

\- start the script.

Voila. Workaround to get instant Gmail notifications (no root)",178

over the last \~500 days, I used a script on my OnePlus 6T, which documented information like the current security patch of my phone, and the time that has passed since the last OTA update.

I did this in order to check how well OnePlus is doing with (security) updates, especially with regard to their ""OnePlus Software Maintenance Schedule"" ([]()). And now that I have all the data, I thought I might as well share it with you.

At first, I made a plot, which shows the age of the security patch over time (starting from April 9th, 2019, half a year after launch): 

* On those days that have a green star, the security patch was very recent (&lt;= 30 days, which is the ways it should be).
* Orange points have a patch that is between 31 and 60 days old,
* the red points are between 61 and 90 days,
* and for the purple points, the security patch is older than 90 days!

**On average, the security patch on the OnePlus 6T was 58 days old**. For comparison, a phone that always gets the latest patch at the beginning of each month (i.e. a Pixel phone), would have an average of \~15 days, and a phone that gets patched at the beginning of each second month would have an average of \~30 days.

I also took a look at the time between new versions of OxygenOS and found that **on average OnePlus updated the OnePlus 6T every** **~~35~~** **41 days. The fastest update was after 18 days and the longest update took 73 days.** (I could also make a plot if you want, but I think that this is less interesting).

Thus, in summary we can say that while OnePlus kept their promise to deliver bimonthly updates, these updates did not always include the most recent security patch.

Finally, it took OnePlus **25 days to upgrade the 6T from Android 9 to Android 10** and the **Linux kernel on the 6T was upgraded only once in all of this time.** Currently, the kernel is 54 revisions behind.

I hope that this data is interesting for some of you.

PS: I also managed to run my script on a Nokia phone with Android One. Once I have enough data for this phone, I might update this post. In general, it would also be nice to compare this data with the one from other manufactures.

\[EDIT\] The 6T launched at the beginning of November 2018, but I only I started logging the data on April 9th, 2019, i.e. half a year after the release of the phone.

\[EDIT\] Here is the code, in case you want to run the macro/script on your own device: [](). I hope that the device properties that I used are available on all device. If this is not the case, please let me know.

\[EDIT\] Updated plot. Did OnePlus keep their promise? OnePlus 6T's history of security patches and OTA's.",484

But there's also the matter of them missing things like message search, contact search, email search, file search, etc all in one unified search bar. It seems apple has this and there are some apps on the play store that can do this but Google doesn't. Google needs a spotlight search",110

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't seen any posts about this so thought I'd post here.  

&amp;nbsp;

So normally if you want to edit or add a smart stack, you more or less have to edit it and remove or reorder the preexisting widget choices there. The only other option is to either smart rotate through them throughout the day or something of the like. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've found a way to make your own smartstack where you can pick and choose the widgets you want showing. Essentially you add whatever widget you want on the homescreen and drag one on top of the other. The most important thing is to make sure they are the same size. You can have as many or as little widgets on rotation for your custom smartstack.

&amp;nbsp;

Apologies if this was already discussed or common knowledge but I haven't found anything like this on the net so thought I'd make a post about it! Hope this helps and hope y'all have a wonderful day! Custom Smart Stacks",169

When you back up your iPhone to iCloud or your computer, your iPhone backup also includes your Apple Watch data. **If you've set up an Apple Watch for a family member, its data is backed up to iCloud directly.**

My only question is: why are direct backups exclusive to Family Setup?* Imagine losing or breaking either your phone or Watch, or your iPhone backup is corrupt resulting in needing to setup as new. You have to setup your Apple Watch all over again, from your watchfaces to your homescreen, your dock, notification settings, Talk app, and so on.

1,0.66,1,0,Davidyoo,"I find this quite intereting and odd thing happened on my Smart Keyboard (just to be clear, the standalone apple bluetooth keyboard, not those products from the ipad product line.): 

I cannot type a single German letter on my Smart Keyboard. 

The common options for typing German (or any other European languages) on an apple device are given by two ways (that i know of). 1) long hit the letter, and wait for the option jump up, then you can select the variations of this letter. Quite useful if you only want to type for a few German words or a name. 2) add a German keyboard into your language input and switch to that keyboard. 

However, i found none of these two options work on my smart keyboard. 1) When you long hit a button on smart keyboard, nothing happens. 2) The language input switching on smart keyboard is given by ctrl + space. This actually works. But when I hit the button according to the German keyboard layout on the smart keyboard, the input is still in the English layout. 

For example, this is what i get from the smart keyboard: `p[;‘`.  While this is the result I get from the virtual keyboard in the same language settings with the same buttons: `püöä`, which is quite interesting. 

So I wonder if there exist an hidden language lock for the smart keyboard, or is my smart keyboard simply broken? Could you type German letter on an english Smart Keyboard?",251

Hi guys I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with the Apple sleep tracking being extremely in accurate. 

To put things in context; I’ve the Apple Watch series 4 that I have been using since it’s release and I’ve used several sleep tracking apps during that time and found only one (that wasn’t paid for/subscription to actually get the results) that gave me close to 100% accuracy so thinking I maybe able to clean up and extra app and use apples built in feature I’ve used their sleep tracking functionality since iOS 14 and watchOS 6/7 launch (can’t remember which is the current version). 

The app I am referring to is called SleepWatch and I’ve found it to be off by no more than 10 minutes at worst. (Though checking today it does appear to be off quite a bit, though it does pull data from sleep health as well)

Since using Apple sleep I’ve found it’s accuracy to be off by up to 4-5 hours! That’s hours! And this has been the case from the beginning of using it. So it’s flagging me for sleeping 10-11 hours each night where as I can confirm I’ve slept at most 7 hours if I am lucky but on average it is 6 hours Apple’s built-in sleep tracker is extremely inaccurate (for me)",251

1,0.61,17,12,sudosussudio,"Previously my boss had put in equipment orders via this and it had worked fine though it was frustrating there was no way to track the courier.

Today I tried it for myself. Waited. And waited. Nothing. \`shop/order/detail\` said delivered and \`shop/order/list\` said ""Arrives today between 12:30 and 2:30 PM"". At 3:30 I called Apple and they said the order had been cancelled because the Postmate ""attempted delivery"" and I'd get my money back in between 7-10 days. Since I used a gift card from trade in that means I won't have this equipment for quite awhile. The order page still says it's coming too and nothing about cancellation. So if I'd picked regular shipping I probably would have gotten it sooner (2-3 days) vs. now I'm looking at 10-13 days. Overall a terrible user experience and would not recommend especially if you're using Apple products for work and actually need something.

1,0.2,0,12,parthaggarwal,"Apple recently held its Time Flies event in which it announced new watches, iPads, and even some subscription services. But I already knew that Apple would announce 2 new apple watches including one affordable one. I knew it would introduce a new iPad air with iPad pro design and Touch ID on top and I knew that it would not announce any iPhones that day. So all of this just made the actual event very boring.

Actually, it was not boring just because everything had leaked, it felt as if the students of a particular group had made a really great PowerPoint presentation with really fancy transitions and every student had to speak his or her portion from the entire presentation.  

This is not a bad thing actually because when Steve Jobs was around he used to present 99% of the stuff and the people who actually worked on those projects didn't get much attention. But what's missing now is Storytelling. None of the people who show up on stage maybe other than Craig Federighi improvise on top of their script. None of them is actually talking to the audience, all of them are just saying.

And Apple is aware of this, so it counters it by producing really great videos that tell stories on their behalf. It's exactly the opposite of what it used to be during the Steve Jobs era. Back then Apple was not as dependent on videos to keep the audience engaged. Steve Jobs was more than enough because of his humor and storytelling skills. 

Plus back then stuff did not leak as frequently as it does now. So I am not excited about the next Apple event which will be of iPhone 12, I'm just excited for the official product video because that is where a story is being told. The Apple we Loved is Dying.",310

1,1.0,2,0,arctrooper55,Recently the apple online store started selling products in India. It is extremely sad to see the terrible support provided by apple. They say chat is available but it's not and the calls to support don't queue up. Is there any way we can let apple know about this or is this deliberate? Terrible support in India,57

1,0.98,3308,293,kdcloudy,"I'm a huge AV nerd and I borrowed a pair of AirPods Pro from a friend to test out the Spatial Audio feature, and I see there's a lot of ambiguity regarding this feature and a lot of misinformation and these are my findings after thorough testing:

Firstly, the technology behind this is fascinating. It uses math and HRTFs to map audio frequencies as if they were around you, along with the extra mile Apple goes to have dynamic data by tracking your head movement through the sensors on the AirPods.

Secondly, content support:
Right now it’s super limited, only Apple TV content mixed in 7.1 and 5.1 or Dolby Atmos works.

What iOS looks for is atleast a 5.1 track output, in Dolby Digital or Digital+ to trigger the Spatial Audio feature hence, AAC won't work, and music won’t work by default. 

And the only apps which output 5.1 audio are AppleTV and Disney+
You can try Tidal if it’s available in your country since that supports Dolby Atmos music, I tried listening to some Shawn Mendes and Ariana Grande on my OnePlus device when I had a subscription but it sounded terrible, music doesn’t work that well with any virtual surround sound tech.

Secondly if you want to watch locally downloaded content, you need to play it back through the built-in QuickTime Player, Infuse doesn’t support Spatial audio yet, and those files need to be 5.1, AC3 in an mp4 container. I have custom converted and muxed some trailers and i'll try linking those below. Just download and Save to Files app and you'll be golden.

If you are willing to shell out money on Apple TV rentals, try out Gravity and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, excellent Atmos mixes with great overhead activity.

In Gravity, around the 42 minute mark, the alarm sound has a great overhead effect.
In M:I-5, around the 50 minute mark, the helicopter blades also provide an excellent spatial effect.

Also PSA: Do not download or try out “3D Audio” or Dolby Atmos sample videos on YouTube, they're mixed and exported as binaural audio, and will work on any pairs of headphones. The specialty of Spatial Audio is that it converts normal 5.1 and 7.1 tracks to Binaural Audio on the fly.

That’s it, Reddit is the only place where I can talk about niche things, hopefully somebody cares lol

EDIT: THANKS FOR THE AWARDS, STRANGERS!

My YouTube video: 

Samples: 

Also my YouTube video was mastered in 5.1 Atmos, and the raw file is in the drive link itself, you can get an idea of how a YouTube video should sound through it :) Everything you need to know about Spatial Audio",435

So I just learned about widgets two days ago.

So far looks kinda cool, a breath of fresh air to my Home Screen. But why do the first party widget suck so much?

For example, I tried the photo widget. It just showed random photos. Seriously? I can’t select albums or specific photos. Shouldnt it work kinda like my Apple Watch photo faces?

One time it even showed a photo of my ex lol and I can’t dismiss it for hours!

I guess this is supposed to be a third party problem? But from what I’ve seen the apps suck also.

What’s going on? Is anyone surprised how limiting the first party widget is?",126
1,0.18,0,34,mimiendera,"I’ve been a devout iPhone owner from their very first iPhone model. I’ve tolerated hiccups with the updates and knew that Apple would get their iOS patches out quickly. 

The iOS 14 has been a monumental FU¢€ UP, the glitches just seems to be growing.  What I have notice so far...(this is in addition of the fact they didn’t let their app developers know about their sudden release of the iOS 14 wtf)

1) Constant freezing of the screen.
2) Some of Apple’s generated passwords being missing to the accounts that I used them for. 
3) Password list in Settings now requires you to scroll, the alphabet sidebar to jump you to the general is MISSING
4) Apple Security trying to get you to change passwords or ask you for passwords that are no longer saved even when using facial recognition. Basically cock blocking  of the tech folks are men so the gender term is fairly accurate. 
5) Photos is no longer intuitive and I bloody hell cannot find the rubbish bin for my deleted photos or most of my other folders. 
6) One of the most egregious one yet is if you rest a thumb or finger on a blank spot on your Home Screen it activates the Edit Page function and you might just be aware of it. 
7)App store may give you their “Logical” version of how your folders should look like and freezing your phone all at once. 
8) Glitchy response when you typing and want to go back a sentence or so to make an edit by using your finger. You can end up in the middle of that word or another word. 

I am sure there is more such as the music but I won’t know that till I open that can of worms. 
In short APPLE, this what I expect of an android phone. I had one for work and honestly for the current bloody nightmare that is the iOS 14 update, Android is looking a better choice.

1,0.9,97,10,morten1389,"With the announcement of the new Apple Watches and iPads last Tuesday (September 15th), I made an interesting discovery when I was looking to order an Apple Watch.

They have suddenly added an option for AppleCare+, this have not been available on any of their products previously in Norway, available on Apple Watch, AirPods, iPad, iPod, iPhone and Macs.

Previously we only had the option to add regular AppleCare, which is essentially only the extended warranty, without coverage for accidental damage. It also seem to have the same new terms as AppleCare+ in other markets have, where you have coverage for two accidents every 12 months, for two years.

More information about AppleCare+ in Norway can be found on Apple's sites [here]().

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** I've also observed they have added AppleCare+ for [Denmark]() and [Finland]() as well, so it does look like they are expanding their offerings of AppleCare+ to more countries.

Previous to the September releases, they only offered AppleCare+ in Sweden, which has physical Apple Stores present.

I'm pretty new to Apple ecosystem, I got MacBook and I'm really enjoying it. I'm coming from Windows/Linux and before I touched MacOS I thought that this OS is way more closed. And that's somewhat true (it's harder to modify existing OS components that on many Linux DE's) but on MacOS user is able to do almost everything, has full **sudo** access. And Apple stated that they want to stay with this idea of having more open OS in case of MacOS.

Meanwhile MacOS is pretty easy-to-understand OS and has very good UX. I love this combination of easiness and possibility to make more advanced things. And MacOS is very secure also.

My question is: **why Apple hasn't go the same way with iOS?** iOS devices are very powerful and unlocking them can provide infinity power for more advanced users. If this is done well, iOS can still be very user-friendly and secure. Why iOS is more 'closed' OS than MacOS?",159

1,0.62,6,4,winsome_losesome,"I don’t know about your experience but recently, I got really turned off how the banner notification has been constantly abused by some apps by sending you ads, promos, nonsense spam, or what not that I just default to turning them off. And since the new widgets came out, it got me thinking about multitasking and how it could be implemented in iOS the way Apple would do it since I’m also getting tired of the clunkiness, or as Craig would put it, heaviness of the app switcher.

So why not have a slideover for the iOS just like in the iPad? Like a persistent drop down banner option for apps but one that you can dismiss and drop down back and forth. It doesn’t have to be interactive but at least it should be able to show some important info just like a widget. This way it wouldn’t be too taxing to the system resources and at the same time, it wouldn’t have the ‘heaviness’ usually involved in switching between apps by swiping left/right or downright going back to your homescreen, and god help you if you have multiple app folders across multiple pages. It doesn’t disrupt what you are doing except hide the top part of your active app so the incentive to not always use it is also there. Not as useful as split screen but could have high utility for simpler things like for waiting for your cab or food, or seeing a couple of lines from your group chat, or a quick glimpse at the weather or map, game scores, music, timer, etc. Very handy when you’d want to glean small, salient info very quickly or persistently. And yes since it’s not a notif, hopefully, can’t be hijacked by the app itself for their own promos.

I know Apple doesn’t like to overcomplicate how their devices work but I think this is a reasonable compromise. They’re already implementing widgets anyway and it sounds like something apple might wanna give a try. Now I realize that this functionality is already somewhat being done by the watch and the new widgets but sometimes it’s gonna be more practical and convenient to have this.

Apple has always has a very tight grip on its aesthetic – I can’t imagine Jony Ive allowing this level of complete user ‘design’ under his regime.

While I’m all for customisation to an extent, this feels a step too far. What does everyone else think? Are Widgetsmith and Shortcuts are ruining iOS design ethic?",82

Maybe I’m using it wrong, but the fact that I can’t tell it how I want things sorted, and am left guessing where my apps are seems silly. I can understand it for some people (e.g. tHe AveRagE UsEr that everyone here defends), but not having the option to just see an alphabetical list without having to pull down makes it a cumbersome experience.

* Rich manga library
* Seamless library syncing with your MangaDex account
* Intuitive search with tag inclusion and exclusion
* Save manga chapters for offline reading
* Widgets!
* Logging in to your MangaDex account couldn't be easier. No more going back and forth to a browser view!

After 9 months from the launch of **Book Track**, I am excited to announce the release of a great new version, which takes the app to the next level. **Book Track 2** introduces a lot of new feature and a new layout on iPadOS 14. 

The app is available on the App Store at this link: []()

The app supports **iOS 14 Widgets** at day one. Two types of widgets are available: the first one shows title and subtitle of the chosen book, the authors and the book progress. The second one, instead, shows a random quote of the chosen book. 

Book Track takes advantage of the new sidebar introduced in the new OS versions. The sidebar shows the main sections of the app and makes available also quick filters for tags, series and reading status. Tag and Series sections are dynamically updated when a new item is added to the app. 

With the new version of Book Track is easy to keep track of the progress of your books. You can easily mark the pages that you have read and a clean graph shows your reading progress through the days. Reading progress can be updated in the book details section of the app or through the new Shortcuts. There are many new features and I hope you will enjoy them all.

More info ara available in the great review published by Ryan Christoffel on **MacStories**: []()

I'm still using the Series 1 Apple Watch and knowing how long it lasted me, I wanted to splurge a little on this one. I opted to use the 'Create Your Style' feature and customize the size, finish and band. I chose a black and white sport loop since it accented the Space Black Titanium well. I checked out and had an estimated delivery date of 9/25-9/28.   


Fast forward to today and I get a text from Apple saying there was an issue with my order. I contacted Apple's text support and was told the configuration I chose was 'accidentally' added to the store and therefore they have to cancel my order. In my case, the only thing that was no longer available was the black and white sport loop band. I asked if there was a possibility of simply selecting a different band but they said it would be impossible to do so as each configuration is its own product.  


Unfortunately, I'm now having to re-order my watch and looking at a delivery date somewhere near the end of November. Really disheartening.   


I was able to call customer support and get a little more help from a very nice agent, but it's still very likely I won't see my watch anywhere near the original delivery date. I just wanted to let others know that this may happen to them as well. If it does, call into customer support rather than utilize the text service. It won't help much but they'll at least work a little hard to rectify the situation. Just a heads up, certain Apple Watch Series 6 configurations offered on launch day were errors. Apple is cancelling those orders and requiring those customers to re-order.",312

1,0.44,0,3,sky_tripping,"*“One conscious breath, in and out, is a meditation”* - Eckhart Tolle

Most of us are busy or preoccupied enough that even one 8-second long investment toward relaxing and calming our mind/body is insanely effective. 

Please don’t just believe me. **Test me on this**. Breathe in deeply. Hold for a moment. Breathe out. This is mindfulness, this is meditation — not some fancy mountaintop experience wearing orange robes catching flies with chopsticks. Sure, that can be meditation, too, but how is that going to help *you*, sitting stressed in your home office or living room, *right now*? 

Do you feed your body water? Do you feed your body food? Do you grant your body sleep? These are all crucial to health. But what about breath? Many humans today are stressed enough that we’re in a constant Fight/Flight/Flee response, which means we’re unconsciously practicing shallow (defensive) breathing. This is great for being “ready”, but it’s terrible for being well or giving crucial rejuvenation time to our mind and body. Deep breathing signals to our body that we’re ok. It is scientifically proven to **immediately** reduce stress hormones, lower blood pressure, improve memory and concentration, increase happiness and feelings of wellness, and overall make us more productive. I can provide plenty of rigorous studies, but you can also feel the benefit for yourself right now. 

#WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS — LET ALONE MY MIND?

Most people get hung up on where to put their hands, which is usually a proxy complaint for being unsure what to do with their mind. The short answer is, it doesn’t matter. This usually doesn’t satisfy most meditation novices or newcomers. Instead, a longer answer is, choose one of the below approaches and see what works for *you* — since this is a very personal experience meant to serve *you*, not some guru, group, etc. None of these is “better” or “worse” than the other. They’re simply *possible ways* you can tap into your own internal process:

**A. Focus on breath/breathing** — Perhaps the most common method, simply focus on your breath. Focus on the sensation as it enters your mouth or nose. Focus on how it feels as it passes through your throat. Feel your lungs as they expand, contract, etc. Feel it as it passes by your nostrils or lips. Notice the sound of your breath. Just pay attention to *any* (or all) aspect(s) of your breath you choose, and *when* (not if) you notice your mind has wandered — simply, gently, and *most importantly of all*, **kindly** guide your attention back to your breath.

**B. Focus on *any* specific thing** — Pick a color. Pick a shape. Pick a person. Pick an object. Pick a part of your body. Pick a word. Pick a phrase (e.g. *“I am happy, I am healthy, I am well”*). Work to gently reaffirm this thought or object of focus in your mind throughout the entire in and out breath. *When* (not if) you notice your mind has wandered — simply, gently, and *most importantly of all*, **kindly** guide your attention back to your chosen focal point.

**C. Choose anti-focus — allow your mind freedom to wander anywhere** — Perhaps the most unexpected of the three, simply give your mind space to go wherever it wants, for any reason, for any amount of time. Simply notice, and practice lovingkindness toward your mind while you notice how much energy it has to run anywhere in the universe once it’s unchained and accompanied by a willing “you”. *When* (not if) you notice where your mind has wandered — smile lovingly and thank your mind for being so diverse and unbounded.

That’s it. How long do you meditate? Well, start with one breath in, one breath out. If it took around 10 seconds, that’s where a lot of the biological change happens most quickly. How did it feel? Want to go longer? Take another deliberate breath. More? Repeat as needed. 

#You don’t need a personal trainer for this. You don’t need a guru. You simply must breathe.

1,0.28,0,17,ToniWonKanobi,"TL;DR: The MX Master 3 mouse feels cheap compared to the Magic Mouse 2

## History with Apple Products

I've been a Mac user since the pre-iPhone days, 2005 or so. (So, not since the Classic Mac OS days, but before Apple was what it is today). Since then, I've always purchased Apple notebooks, as I was in school for years, and afterwards, I liked (still do) taking my computer to work to dink around in between patients. My primary input device has always been the built-in laptop keyboard and trackpad. There's a lot which could be said regarding Apple quality, and how their trackpads have traditionally been the target of all Windows laptops, but that's a discussion for another day, and I really don't want to invite any more vitriol than necessary.

Fast-forward a few years, to when I started docking my laptop while at home. During this time, I was using Apple's wireless Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse (along with the Magic Trackpad). I love the gesture support on both the Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse.

## Coronavirus

This past spring, during the shelter-in-place order following the coronavirus pandemic, I found myself stuck at home, bored, with nothing to do besides housework, yard work, and mindless internet research. So, like any nerd, I got into mechanical keyboards. This has been a rabbit hole of an adventure. Six months after discovering the hobby, I spend a lot of time in various custom keyboard people/companies Discord servers, I browse r/mechmarket a lot, and I'm always looking for the next best thing. In case anyone cares, all my customs use vintage key switches and keycaps. (I have ai03's [Lunar [AEK]](), using [Alps SKCM oranges]() and M3501/M3012J AEK keycaps, and I have Clueboard's [AEK64](), with [Alps SKCM blues]() and M0115 Arabic keycaps, and I have [Mekanisk's Klippe T (R3)](), with [Alps SKCL greens]() and [SGI ""Granite"" keycaps](). I also have some vintage boards that I plan on using in future 60% projects: a minty [Dell AT101]() and [NeXT Non-ADB (AAE)]().)

Alas, I digress.

## Enter Logitech MX Master 3

Because I was having so much fun with mechanical keyboards, my eyes started to wander toward the Magic Mouse 2 just to the right of my keyboard. I remembered seeing MKBHD and other YouTubers review the MX Master 3 (and MX Master 2 before), and it always received glowing praise. I was worried I would miss the ability to swipe across the top of the Magic Mouse 2 (for various macOS gestures), but figured the Gesture button on the MX Master 3 would suffice.

### Gesture Support for MX Master 3

The Logi Options app really does allow a myriad of options regarding the Gesture button (and all the buttons!) on the MX Master 3. The gesture implementation is not as easy/seamless as the Magic Mouse 2, but it's doable. You press the gesture button on the thumb rest area, and while doing so, translate the body of the mouse in one of the four directions to invoke a gesture previously invoked by just swiping two fingers across the top of the mouse (for the Magic Mouse 2). Obviously not as easy as on the Magic Mouse 2, but I could probably get used to it over time.

## Finally, Why The MX Master 3 Sucks (For Me)

Simply put, this mouse feels cheap.

* Weight: Despite it being physically much larger than the Magic Mouse 2, the MX Master 3 doesn't weigh considerably more. It feels way lighter than it should for its size, at least in my opinion. (This is not unlike how Leica glass, despite their diminutive size, always feel like a super dense piece of kit, which partially contributes to the feeling that one is holding something proper and precious.)

* Plastic Feel: The ""soft-touch"" materials are just a little too plastic-y, and not quite ""rubbery"" enough to feel as premium as I assumed all mice should feel. Of course, the Magic Mouse 2 is basically just a big piece of Jony Ive plastic, but it certainly feels nicer than whatever they use to cover the MX Master 3

* Scroll Wheel Finish: Logitech opted for some kind of shiny coated plastic, meant to evoke polished stainless steel, I suppose. But it's clearly a hit-and-miss situation

* Scroll Wheel Vibration When Shaken: Because Logitech employs a feature called SmartShift, wherein the mouse can automatically switch between ratcheting and ""free-wheeling,"" the scroll wheel is not that stable when the mouse is physically shaken. There's a lot of side-to-side play of the scroll wheel, especially when in ""free-wheeling"" mode.

* Click Buttons: Coming from my current mechanical keyboard hobby, I feel quite qualified to say that the clicks on the MX Master 3 are more tinny and high pitched, and less thick (thocky‽) than the clicks on the Magic Mouse 2. There seems to be less definition in the clicks. When I click the Magic Mouse 2, there's a definite beginning and end to the click. It's a heavier actuation force, I think. On the MX Master 3, when depressing a click button, there's some play, even in the button-depressed state

## Thoughts

Ultimately, Logitech is not an Apple-specific peripheral company (duh). And, to be honest, it shows. A lot of Apple enthusiasts are dismissed for being brand sheeps, and there's certainly good reason for that. You can say what you will about those followers, but us true believers enjoy a level of hardware fit and finish, thought, and intention that is unmatched in the PC world. I think that's what's going on here. 

My expectation was that the MX Master 3 would be as nice-feeling as Apple's latest mouse. That's just not the case.

So if there are any devout Magic Mouse 2 users out there, who like me, were curious about YouTube's favorite mouse, I'd encourage you to save your time and just skip the MX Master 3.

And if there are any folks out there who have tried other ergonomic mice, and have found one whose build quality matches Apple's (is that even possible?), please let me know! 🖱️ Logitech MX Master 3 Feels Cheap (Compared to Apple Magic Mouse 2)",1012

I expect they will pick a letter and a version number to remain consistent with their other SoCs. Since there will be multiple SKUs, we might see some suffix to delineate core counts or the like (A14, A14X). Since it's a new line, I can only assume it will use '1' (U1, T1, S1, etc).

If this is an intentional design, it’s really quite nice. It makes use of the OLED capabilities of newer iPhones and really shows off the new minimalist Siri design. 

The fact that little orange recording indicator also illuminates, and that the rest of the screen also eventually fades in could indicate it might be a bug, where they never told the Siri indicator to wait for the screen to wake properly, but man if it’s on purpose I really love it!

1,0.47,0,11,DanTheMan827,"Let me start by saying this is not intended to be a troll post but rather to foster a discussion about [the guidelines themselves]().

The following are the rules I have issues with, why, and how I would modify them:

&gt;**2.5.2** Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code which introduces or changes features or functionality of the app, including other apps. Educational apps designed to teach, develop, or allow students to test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes. Such apps must make the source code provided by the Application completely viewable and editable by the user.

The part about not being able to execute external code completely eliminates virtual machine applications for running operating systems within a hypervisor, it does not prevent an app from including a virtual machine, but it would effectively be useless because it would mean there could be no external connectivity within the virtual machine or a way to transfer files into the virtual machine.

&gt;**2.5.6** Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.

This completely prevents any alternative web browser from using any engine except WebKit, I would remove it... Although even if this guideline didn't exist, **2.5.2** would also prevent any web browser that could run javascript from being submitted.

&gt;**2.5.9** Apps that alter or disable the functions of standard switches, such as the Volume Up/Down and Ring/Silent switches, or other native user interface elements or behaviors will be rejected. For example, apps should not block links out to other apps or other features that users would expect to work a certain way.

This should be on a case-by-case basis, allowing certain apps like cameras the ability to use the volume buttons as a shutter release allows them to simulate how a physical camera works, and in fact the included camera app does this.

&gt;**4.2.7 Remote Desktop Clients:** If your remote desktop app acts as a mirror of specific software or services rather than a generic mirror of the host device, it must comply with the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) The app must only connect to a user-owned host device that is a personal computer or dedicated game console owned by the user, and both the host device and client must be connected on a local and LAN-based network.  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.  
&gt;  
&gt;(c) All account creation and management must be initiated from the host device.  
&gt;  
&gt;(d) The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user. For the sake of clarity, transactions taking place within mirrored software do not need to use in-app purchase, provided the transactions are processed on the host device.  
&gt;  
&gt;(e) Thin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.

This one is a big one...

* (a) Eliminate the part about only being able to connect over a local network, this prevents apps from providing the functionality to connect over the internet
* (a) Change the part about being able to only connect to user-owned devices because that prevents an app from connecting to a remote computer or server provided by work, school, or any remote server the user is renting/leasing
* Remove section (c), this prevents any service that provides access cloud-based computer access for a monthly fee.
* (d) This entire section prevents remote desktop apps from presenting any storefront to the user, you would not be able to access any storefront like Amazon, Steam, Microsoft Store, or any other form of store
* (e) This section conflicts with section **4.9.1** which states cloud game streaming services must provide a thin client for each game, either remove it or **4.9.1**.

I would like to point out that most remote access apps already violate sections (a) and (d)

&gt;**4.9.1** Each streaming game must be submitted to the App Store as an individual app so that it has an App Store product page, appears in charts and search, has user ratings and review, can be managed with ScreenTime and other parental control apps, appears on the user’s device, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.9.2** Streaming game services may offer a catalog app on the App Store to help users sign up for the service and find the games on the App Store, provided that the app adheres to all guidelines, including offering users the option to pay for a subscription with in-app purchase and use Sign in with Apple. All the games included in the catalog app must link to an individual App Store product page.

This conflicts with **4.2.7(e)** which states thin clients for cloud-based apps are not allowed and will  result in hundreds of thin clients being submitted to the App Store, as an alternative there should be an API for apps to create shortcuts on the home screen with unique icons, titles, and content rating information that go directly to that game in the catalog app permitted by **4.9.2**.

What would you change about the guidelines if you had the ability and why? If you were able to change the App Store guidelines, what would you change, and why?",935

Your Two-factor Authentication is really an over-rated, meaningless and defective layer of security that has put me through several miserable wait times (24 Hours + 1 week + 8 Hours) on a roundabout path of madness.

**Meaningless** \- The question is why? Why are you punishing your customers through forced wait times? My iphone 8 dies and my icloud is disabled for having forgotten password and the only solution you have for me is to wait to for 1 week? – for what – background check? Why can’t you verify my identity like most other legit entities that are straightforward and effective– via email verification, security questions, or even physical proof of ID at a near by apple store? When DocuSign can verify my identity in just few minutes – why can’t you?

**Over-rated**– Your complex security forced me to buy an android just so I would have a “trusted device” associated with my phone number. Luckily I was able to cut through my wait time by re-trying and remembering my old password using android as my “trusted device”. But even with the password, I no longer was able to access icloud. I still needed “two- factor authentication” code.  Seriously??

**Defective** \- I received like 5 codes, sometimes two at the same time and none of them worked. Every one of them returned with “incorrect verification code”. After trying one too many times, it stopped working to provide a code for “security reasons” returning a message “Too many codes sent- try again later”. Unbelievable! I cried! 

Seriously I tried all possible ways your Apple support provided me  – including installing App support on a friend’s mobile device, providing my friend’s phone number as a trusted device, activating my old iPhone 5s, accessing icloud settings and security on my MacBook, updating my MacBook OS, using , waiting for hours on hold and speaking with at least 5 apple advisors – who were nice and patient enough to walk me through the process of verification only to end up saying that I have to wait and try again.  

I’m writing this on the 4th day after the 5th advisor I spoke to, finally gave me the magic key and I got in. I got my icloud access. But was this really necessary?

Over the 8 years I’ve been a loyal iPhone user as my dad is a big fan. I’ve tolerated iTunes syncing, photos and video sharing and file transfer (that has no warning for duplicates and redundancies) across devices back and forth by pulling on my hairs and rubbing my forehead in frustration. This was the last straw!!! 

I’ve realized the new LG – K30 I bought from Target for $150 has everything that iPhone has and it comes with an SD card and it makes my life so much simpler to transfer photos and I can simple copy, cut and paste and I’m not forced to backup on a cloud which I am not comfortable with. Inexpensive – robust - simple – no warranty and no security necessary!

Old widgets were resizable. You had your iPhone and watch connected? You used the small battery wdiget. You connected your airpods too? You clicked on the little arrow and the widget would grow.

They also showed better info, they could even play videos.

And they were more interactive, you could mark reminders as done, or stop, pause, and start timers, or write on them to save notes or get translations. All of that without opening the apps. The new widgets are just glorified app icons that only launch apps. It's hilarious to me so many people were complaining about the clock widget missing or being out of sync and it's just a giant version of the clock icon.

I also don't understand what's the big deal about having them on the homescreen. The older widget sheet was accessible from anywhere, so it's not like you had to do extra work to access the widgets. If anything, now it actually takes more work to launch apps since you have them spread through more pages or in the app library all the way to the end of the homescreen.

For example, the iPhone XR (\~2 years old) is going on sale for around $400 as of now and the iPhone 11 (\~1 year old) is going on sale for around $580, both good condition. Is the better value to wait one year, two years, 3 years? Maybe even longer? The phone starts becoming very hard to sell after 3-4 years I'd imagine, so is it even worth it at that point? How often is most optimal to upgrade iPhone in terms of value",122

1,0.89,160,60,lord-bailish,"Apologies for formatting here, I’m on mobile. Overall I really like iOS 14. 




**Widgets**

The widgets look nice and fit in with the overall iOS aesthetic (as expected), but sometimes I feel it would be better to just have the app icon instead. But I also don’t love widgets, so that could be a bit biased. I just wish they were more interactive. 

The Smart Stack is a good concept, but I want to see what developers do with widgets before making a final judgement on it. It’s nice that it figures out which ones you use at what times and brings them up automatically; but it’s not perfect. For example, the Maps widget will pull an address from either your next calendar event and have directions ready, or make a guess as to where you want to go based on previous activity if there’s none available.

I guess my main beef with widgets is that I wish they did things that were more specific. Like the Photos widget for example: I wish I could pick a specific album to display instead of just the suggested memories. They’re good overall, but they have some annoying quirks. 



**Home Screen** 

I like the changes to the Home Screen overall.

The ability to just hide specific home screens without having to move all the apps to the library is fantastic. It saves a lot of micromanaging having to select each individual app and remove it. 

However; the fact that you can’t rearrange them from that screen is kind of infuriating. In order do rearrange them, you’d have to go do the micromanaging thing I mentioned before and either remove all the apps from the Home Screen to get that particular one to disappear, or move them to another screen. 

Apple, if you’re reading this, allow me to move the frickin screens around!



**App Library** 

The App Library is nice, but it takes some getting used to. Most app drawers just put everything alphabetically which is great. The App Library in iOS automatically organizes all the apps into categorized folders instead. 

This is a great idea; but like I said, it takes some getting used to. It took me a bit to figure out which folder a couple specific apps went into; but other than that it was fine. 

If you don’t like the categories, you can just pull down or tap the search bar at the top to get an alphabetized list. 

Overall, the App Library takes some getting used to, but is implemented pretty well, IMO. I don’t use it much though, because I just use Spotlight Search to open apps not already on my Home Screen. 



**Activity/Fitness App** 

I like some of the changes here, but don’t like others. I do like that they changed the name of the app. It makes more sense; especially considering the announcement of Fitness+ today; which I’m sure was the reason for the name change in the first place. 

I like that they combined everything into the two sections, but I wish they had kept the calendar part separate. To view the calendar you now have to open your activity for the day, and then open the calendar. I preferred having an overview of the month and then looking at each day from there. That’s purely subjective though. 

Other than consolidating everything to the two tabs, not much has changed from what I can tell. 



**Messages/Phone**

I love that you can now pin conversations in Messages. It’s something I’ve wanted for awhile. It’s not quite how I would have done it, from a visual standpoint, but that’s not a bad thing. It works well and I’m glad it’s here. 

However, somehow autocorrect continues to get worse for me. I don’t know if this is just an issue for me, but autocorrect is straight up retarded. I’ll spell a word wrong by one letter, and not only does it not correct it; it tells me it’s wrong, but won’t suggest a replacement when I select it. Again; I don’t know if it’s just me, but it drives me crazy. 

As for incoming calls; FINALLY they made it so the calls don’t take up the whole screen. It’s just like a regular banner notification that you can flick away. It’s about time, Apple!



**Siri**

Oh, Siri. I wish you were better. 

I don’t use Siri for much. Mostly it’s just for reminders, timers, alarms, and the occasional text message. I wish I could use Siri for other things, but it can never seem to understand when I talk to it. 

Siri will pick up entirely different words, not recognize contact names, give me answers that have nothing to do with the question I asked, and more. 

As with the autocorrect thing; I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t use Siri hardly at all because it just doesn’t work right for me. 

The new UI for Siri is great, but it’s not useful enough for me. 



**TL;DR**

Widgets are good, they just need a couple things to be more useful. The App Library serves its purpose very well. There’s a lot of QoL improvements that I was waiting for that I enjoy immensely. Siri is... Siri. 

Overall, iOS 14 is a great step forward, but needs a few tweaks to be the best version of itself. My take on iOS 14 after living on the public beta since last month. TL;DR at the bottom.",902

First and foremost, I just don't see the use case. I primarily use my iPhone on the go. When I don't want to use that (in my bed or on a couch), I use my MacBook Pro. And when I need more than that, I either plug into a monitor and sit down at a disk or use my desktop PC. The iPad doesn't fit into any of these situations. 

I know iPapOS has some a long way, but i still just don't that much differentiation from iOS, nor is It a replacement for a Mac. It sort of sits in the middle of the two, a place where I never find myself needing a separate device. And physically, I find the iPad is a pain to use in bed or on my lap. Light as It may be, it's really uncomfortable to hold my arm up to interact with It in any situation. I also strongly maintain there's no replacement for a physical keyboard and track pad. 

Before you ask, I've tried iPads. Many times. I've purchased iPads and sold them, borrowed them, and tried to completely convert to one. No matter what I do, It just doesn't click. 

Plenty of people I know (and all the sales figures) indicate that users are over the moon about their iPads, and I truly feel like I'm part of an almost non-existent minority that thinks they're just blown up, uncomfortable iPhones. Does anyone else agree? And for those who would die for their iPads, what keeps you coming back for more? Anybody else here just not ""get"" the iPad?",309

Before you jump on me, I understand what’s what and we are kinda in an echo chamber where majority here probably understand the differences but what about everyone else?

iPad 

We should have an iPad se, and iPad, and an iPad Pro. Simple. Why is that so hard. 

Let’s look at the se:
The current iPad would be the se and would come in two form factors: the 9.7” and the 7.9”. They should BOTH start at 329 (maybe make the regular size a tiny bit more expensive and bring the smaller size down to 300). The fact that the current mini is $70 more than the regular iPad is flat out dumb. (I know baseline storage isn’t the same currently)

The iPad:
The current air would move to this new moniker. I personally think it’d be smart to offer this in a mini form factor with all screen. Or up it like an inch. 
Side note: What bothers me right now is that if I was an average consumer there’s no reason for me to go spend the extra money on an 11” pro when all the current air lacks  is pro-motion, Face ID, and quad speakers. And tests aren’t out, those stereo speakers might actually get decently loud. Of course I won’t discredit Lidar but that seems like more of a future selling point to me. 

The Pro:
Leave it. It’s fine and it works. 


So we have 2 sizes for each, the naming makes sense (to me) and falls in line with everything the iPhone SE is about.
Let’s look at the watches now. This one is tough because the naming system makes sense on its own. But when you look at what the se is all about the series 3 falls more in line with this than the newly released se does. But you also don’t want to call a watch “pro”. That seems tacky honestly and doesn’t feel like a good move marketing wise. Also the fact that the series 3 has totally different cases sizes could come off as confusing.

To me I might lose some people here (not that I had many to begin with haha) but I would just axe the series 3 and have the se and the Apple watch. Also I’d ditch the series number (just like they did with iPads). 


Let’s move to iPhones. Who is buying the XR!? Why does Apple still carry this? I understand the idea is to hit each price point with a phone but I think if you’re spending $600 on a phone you have an extra $100. And if you’re on a budget there’s the se. So let’s have an iPhone Pro, an iPhone, and an iPhone se. 

iPhone Pro
We can ditch the numbers all together. And let’s ditch the max please. The current iPad pros don’t get called pro and pro max. A pro is a pro. 

iPhone 
Let’s have two sizes like the pro! Maybe kick the smaller one down to the price of the current xr and raise the bigger one a bit closer or to the existing 11. 

iPhone se
Add a bigger screen option. That’s it. Please, we don’t need to add on a name to know it’s a bigger phone. We can see that. It’s not hard for a sales rep to ask, “do you want the big one or the small one?” (That applies to this whole naming rant.)

Let’s talk about Macs now. This isn’t too bad as it sits currently. Mainly, let’s just get rid of the “air” and call it MacBook. So we can have the MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac mini. This is pretty fine, we can differ from the naming system because these computers are totally different from mobile devices. 

Displays... jeez... what the absolute heck do all these words and letters mean haha. (I mean I do know what they mean but it’s ridiculous) Super Retina XDR, excuse me wtf? Maybe let’s just have Retina, Retina Plus, XDR, and XDR Plus. 

Retina
Pretty much every baseline product Apple offers can use this name for the display. All the se’s, and the MacBook. 

Retina plus
Pretty much takes the place of Liquid Retina for mobile devices and on computers occupy MacBook pros

XDR
You can call the display on the iPhone Pros XDR and actually I’d like to call iPad Pro displays XDR as well and that would make more sense once Apple adds pro-motion to iPhones. The 2 iMacs would fall under this. I guess the current series 6 watch fits under this too, at least in my head.(I’m being lazy now, you could make an argument that iPhones and iPads don’t display 4K content and don’t deserve the XDR name and I’d agree with you) 

XDR Plus
This would be, for right now, just for the current display. 

It’s funny I don’t agree with these display names but I think it’s very Apple to not dive into the specs and just say; this is good, this is great, this is better, and this is the best. 


I kinda miss simpler times when we just had iPhone and iPad and iPod: shuffle, nano, classic, touch and MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro. This is mildly alarming right now, this reminds me of a pre Jobs Apple where there were endless products with endless names. A proposal for product renaming/restructuring",957

There are many controversies and rumours and thoughts on why Apple is removing the charge bricks from iPhone(and now Apple Watch). That it is for slimmer box, e-recycling, more revenue bla bla bla. But since watching the event and the website update, I sort of got what Apple is aiming for in another view, which leads up to the above reasons anyway. 

In my personal thought, Apple is trying to push through full usb-c support at least on the wall plug side and at the same time drop 5w manufacturing altogether. 

To support that, 

1. the new iPads are getting a usb-c power brick(even iPad 8th gen!) 

2. apple watch has a usb-c end magnetic charger listed on the accessories page. Although there is nowhere mentioned if usb-a or c cable is coming in the box. 

3. iPhone pro 11 got usb c to lightning. 

4. apple watch and iPhones(non pros) are the only two devices that comes with a 5w/usb a charger (Don’t know why charge brick is gone on pros as well tho. Maybe those are not going?)

So Apple wants to phase out usb a and 5w at the same time not willing to provide faster chargers. 

In the near future, there would be no 5w charger/ no usb a power brick and that would trim down some of the little messy charger/cable supply for Apple. 

How do you think? My thoughts on removing charge bricks",249

We are 2 days away from Apple's event and as always, this subreddit's rule/operation will change to accommodate the influx of new users and to ensure that everything goes smooth. 

One of these changes is restricting the ability to submit posts to moderators only. This helps us control spam to a minimum, as well as control rule breaking posts (i.e. reposts). 

Some users thought that they would like to shift discussions from the main event thread to a separate thread as announcements are made, and we agreed. Starting a few events ago, we  (mods) started to submit articles with breaking news from the event so that those threads can become the centralized discussion for say, the new iPhone or the new iOS.

Last event (WWDC '20), a few Redditors thought that we were getting paid MacRumors and/or 9to5Mac because we submitted posts coming from those sources during the event. I want to take this space to clarify that no one in the mod team is being paid by any blog/press so that they can get their articles submitted by us. We will submit whichever article we find first. If 9to5 posted the article first, they will go on the board. Same thing with The Verge, MacRumors, you name it. 

We're essentially [copying the same actions other subreddit takes before huge events]() to minimize spam, rule breaking content. 

I hope this post clarifies where we come from, and see you on Tuesday!

Before we go any further I'd like to make a few assumptions. Im going to be assuming that everyone will be watching at 720P. Some people dont have the bandwidth for 1080P so 720p is realistic. 

Now we must figure out how much data one hour of YouTube at 720p uses. [This]() report from android authority puts that value at 1.2 -2.7 GB . Well assume 2 Gigs per hour. Now Apples last event WWDC, has 10M views on YouTube. But not every ones going to sit through the entire thing. So lets say the average person will watch an hour of the almost two hour event (Audience retention on YouTube is about 50% anyway). So over a few days or weeks Youtube will have to serve about 20 million gigabytes of Apple event data to people. 

Now we have to figure out how much that will cost YouTube. [Here]() you can find out how much google charges google cloud users to move around a gigabyte of data. They charge about 8 cents per gigabyte. But google isn't paying those rates. There are a lot of figures for the margins on cloud computing [this]() article puts it at 60% and [this]() article puts it at 35%. So lets assume that Google operates at a 50% Margin. So that means that it'll cost them 4 cents to deliver one GB of data.

That brings their total to **$800,000**. Now there are some costs that I haven't looked at here, it takes a bit of processing to encode that video and send it to the end user and that costs money. But I am not going to add that here as we've made a lot of assumptions above. So it could cost google anywhere from $800k to well over $1M. 

But dont feel too bad, since YouTube is a $15 billion business a year, they will have made about $3.4 over those two hours. Heres how much tomorrow's Apple event is gonna cost Google",371

I'm the developer of Apollo for Reddit, a Reddit app for iOS that the Apple community has been really kind to in the past. I wanted to keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing (not a lot of people seem to know but Apollo is my full-time job!) so I thought I'd make a post showing all the goodies in Apollo version 1.9.

Download link: 

In a nutshell, Apollo is a Reddit app built from the ground up to be a first-class app for iOS. I didn't want just another cross-platform hybrid app that feels wonky, but an app built specifically to feel right at home on iOS and take advantage of all of its features. All while being super fast, clean, and very customizable, with a ton of awesome power features like a super-charged media viewer with GIF scrubbing, swipe gestures, slick comments view, smart rotation lock, and so much more. And free to use as long as you want (with the option to support for a few bucks).

My mom also says it's great:  Plus over 100K 5-star reviews from not my mom!

Oh, and there's a TestFlight signup at the bottom if you want to beta test the app, as well as details on the iOS 14 update to drop when iOS 14 does!

Anyway, without further ado here's the changelog:

## Changelog

Apollo 1.9's a massive update to Apollo that's taken months and months to complete, but I'm really happy with the result, and it brings together a ton of ideas from the community to make Apollo even nicer to use. The update includes a variety of features around crossposts, flair, new app icons, translation, and quality of life improvements. Thanks to everyone who writes in via email or via the [ApolloApp subreddit](), your suggestions for what you want to see in Apollo help immensely and really motivate me to keep making Apollo better and better.

Without further ado, here are the changes included in this 1.9 update to Apollo:

### Crosspost Viewing

Crossposting (taking an existing post and reposting it to a similar subreddit) has been a big part of Reddit for ages, but recently it became a full-fledged feature where you can see exactly which subreddit it came from, and quickly jump to the original post. Apollo now supports this fully, so you can see the interesting content of the post, but also quickly jump over to read the original discussion! Often it's like getting two interesting discussions in one!

### Crossposting

Similar to being able to view crossposts, you can also easily perform a crosspost if you want as well! Simply select the post you want to crosspost, write a title, select the subreddit to crosspost it to, and bam, you're off to the races.

### Image Flair

Flair is a little “tag” users can add to their usernames in subreddit, and some subreddits even allow small images/icons to be added in addition to text, like the icon for your favorite sports team, or a character from your favorite TV show. Apollo now shows these beautifully!

### Setting Your Flair

In addition to being able to view the flair as discussed in the previous item, you can now set your own flair! Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs so you can add a little personality to your comments, showing which language you’re learning, your username in a video game the subreddit is about, your fitness goals, etc.

### View Long Flair

Some users set loooong flair, and as a result it can get off, which can be annoying when you’re trying to figure out what it says. Well be annoyed no longer, for you can simply tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!

### Find Posts with Same Flair

If the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs (say, being able to tag whether your question is about a certain character, or a certain topic), you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.
    
### 5 (Yeah, Five!) New App Icons!

This update has taken a ton of time to work on, and as a result I was slightly behind in including the Ultra icons I wanted to include, but as a result there's now a proper Icon Bonanza, with five new icons being included in this update. The first three are Ultra icons, all made by the same incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles, who I’ve been a fan of for a long time. I love how these turned out, we have our beloved Apollo mascot reimagined as an angel, a devil, as well as a zany pilot, all in gorgeous, colorful iconography. But those three icons aren't all! Next up, we have a beautiful new Apollo icon representing the trans pride flag (originally created by Monica Helms), which came out really awesome and is a great addition. And last but not least, our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, makes his second appearance with the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon! I love this set of icons so much, it’s going to be really hard to choose.

### Easy Language Translation

Reddit is home to a diverse set of communities that have a variety of fascinating conversations, but sometimes it’s tricky to understand what’s being said if the conversation is in a language you’re not familiar with. Heck, you might even have no idea what the language is! Now Apollo will be able to detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! It is so handy, whether you’re following a fascinating conversation or even trying to learn a new language.

### Fast Subreddit Selector

Whether you’re trying to add a single subreddit to a filter, or adding multiple subreddits at a time to a multireddit, Apollo is now even faster at doing these tasks, with an auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.

### Total Collapsed Comments &amp; Remembering Collapsed Comments

Two handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation, which can be super handy for viewing a comment thread. The second thing, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!

### New Settings, Filters Tweaks, Bug Fixes, and More!

A bunch of awesome new settings have been added to Apollo, like being able to disable the auto-looping of videos with audio, or being able to make it so translation options always show up. Filtering is also even more powerful, with your filters being able to target flair and links as well (in addition to the title), and fixes a few filtering bugs. Apollo also now shows videos from Reddit’s experimental 'RPAN' service, which is essentially a kind of live stream post that you can now view within Apollo. Of course there's a bunch of other small bug fixes around Apollo, from the occasional account accidentally signing out, to video bugs, to Apollo quitting in the background when it shouldn’t, as well as a bunch of other small tweaks across the app to improve your quality of life while browsing!

### Known Issues

(To be fixed very shortly. Please let me know if you're on the iOS beta or a stable version because a lot of the issues are understandably only present on the iOS beta, but a fix for those will be out soon as well when iOS 14 drops)

- In weird cicrcumstances you can get duplicated audio
- When rotating device it can sometimes throw you up the feed
- Some accounts with a lot of data can have a bit of lag when returning from background (if this happens to you please send me your logs, Settings tab &gt; About &gt; Logs)

## TestFlight and iOS 14 Beta

I've been working hard at an iOS 14 update with widgets, picture in picture video, a new photo picker, and much more, so if you're interested in beta testing that and providing your feedback/bugs, that would be awesome! You can sign up here: 

Also note that for this 1.9 update I'm testing a ""phased release"" feature in App Store Connect so it may take a few days to get out to everyone, but the TestFlight beta has it immediately if you're willing to endure some testing and providing feedback as well. :)

If you have any ideas about future updates, suggestions, or just general questions I'm happy to answer as well. It sounds bullshitty but I genuinely do build Apollo with the community in mind and giving people the Reddit app of their dreams.

\- Christian [Self Promo Saturday] Today I released version 1.9 of my Apollo for Reddit app, which includes a ton of new features and additions like beautiful crossposting, rich flair controls, comment translation, a new subreddit selector, new app icons, and more! iOS 14 TestFlight beta signup inside too!",1529

1,0.86,159,175,imaginfinite,"This is a Public Service Announcement for everyone to make sure to obtain an original Apple Store receipt when buying a secondhand Mac. The removal of activation lock will only be resolved by submitting original Apple Store receipt.


 I bought my 16” 2019 Macbook Pro here through r/appleswap and the previous owner bought it sealed refurbished through Swappa. So the original owner(person from swappa or whoever sold it to him did not have the apple reciept which was required by the activation lock team to remove the lock.

I went through multiple senior apple advisors. Went to the apple store and had a genius tech help me. Wrote to the Apple Developer Team support. Spoke to Customer Relations and nobody was able to remove the activation lock. I sent whatever information I had and the previous owner had from appleswap (swappa reciept showing serial#, paypal reciept, screenshot of the macbook being under my iCloud account. None of this was enough to remove the activation lock. The only way it was going to be resolved was with an official apple reciept. Email or paper copy. 

I understand now that I should have probably not bought on appleswap without the original reciept. However before the T2 chips were introduced to the macbooks(2018 and later) All that was needed to make sure that the Macbook was safe to use was to make sure no iCloud account was attached. This was my first time purchasing a secondhand Macbook that was made after 2018. I had bought two Macbook Pros before this (2014 15” and 2007 15”). 

My whole gripe with this problem is that there was no previous person who we could contact to get the details to remove the activation lock since Apple never removed the lock when they refurbished it because the previous owner before me bought it sealed refurbished from swappa so he was technically the first user to attach his iCloud on the Macbook Pro after the refurbishment process.

The second issue is that the activation lock got triggered after I was attempting to install the Big Sur beta software in the beginning of July. I understand beta software comes with bugs but as a user who uses Xcode to build applications I had a reason to install it. I had also used the Macbook for a whole month before this issue arose. 

Third issue is that this was a KNOWN issue in the apple developer forums. Plenty of people who were original macbook owners could not access their macbooks with their own iCloud accounts. Apple decided that they would just ask everyone for their apple reciept leaving secondhand owners to be left with dead weight.

Fourth issue is that the first apple advisor i spoke with assured me that the way to fix the issue was to remove the macbook from my iCloud account. I believe that if it was still attached I might have had better luck proving the Macbook was mine. Apple team completely disregarded this fact that I kept bringing up. 

I understand the security behind the T2 chip and the activation lock. But if I was able to show them proof that I had it attached to my icloud and proof of receipt from a previous seller with the serial number why would this not be sufficient to removed the activation lock that they themselves forgot to remove during the refurbishment process?

I’m currently still trying to figure out what to do with the macbook that I paid almoat $2500 for. I could do a chargeback or open a case in paypal to get it resolved but then that leaves the previous owner with the same dead weight. 

By far the worst experience i’ve had with apple throughout all my years of being a customer. I guess some things you learn things the hard way. Always ask for the receipt.

EDIT:
Had to make an edit to add a few more details.

This is a screenshot from my phone. Same one I sent to apple proving that the mac was tied to my account and I enabled Find My Mac from the Macbook. How was I able to do this if the activation Lock said it was not tied to mines? Also apple asked me to remove the mac from my account in order to remove the activation lock. Thus now leaving me with no connection the macbook i have in my possession that nobody has marked Lost or stolen.



This is just a Macrumors Forum thread detailing several people with the issue. Most affected were 2019 16” MacBooks that had installed Big Sur Beta. Same macbook I have in my possession. Thanks

1,0.9,71,33,arthurofbabylon,"Hi r/apple – I originally built [Minimal | Notes]() because my dream writing app just did not exist. So every feature that lands in Minimal originates from a real need, something particular (maybe a little odd), and something that isn’t adequately being served by existing notes apps.

So here’s the story behind Publish as Website, Minimal’s latest feature.

**I wanted an easy way to share essays and little articles that I write.** Yes, I could copy/paste and publish it to Medium or send a few emails, but I really just wanted to take my note, convert it to a website exactly as it is, and share it with the people that I want to connect with. Think of it as bringing a blogging tool inside of a notes app, without adding any complexity or ugliness.

So now that it’s live, **Minimal reduced the number of taps required to publish from tens or hundreds to like, 2 taps.** (Okay, technically 3 taps.) Boom, boom, it’s published, here’s the website. And the websites are beautiful – here’s an example: []()

# How it works
To publish, open a note &gt; tap the action button in the top-right corner &gt; select “Publish as Website.” The website will go live in microseconds.

As you edit your note, the website automatically updates.

To remove the website, just delete the note or tap “Unpublish.”

# Inspiration
I love []() – I use it to create just about every website: it’s easy, fun, and beautiful. And it occurred to me that this kind of workflow should exist for articles, essays, thoughts, poems, etcetera. Minimize taps, maximize beauty. Make expression easy.

I also love beautiful typography. Avenir Next is a wonderful typeface (really, all of these hyper round sans serifs are like 😍🥰), off-white and dark-dark-gray are such soothing colors, and **ample empty space is probably the best thing ever.** And to have these websites be so extremely readable (think: max line width of some 65 characters or so) is just cool. 

The one other piece of inspiration – strange as it might sound – is software documentation. I love the big headers, short paragraphs separated by double returns, hyper-pragmatic design.

# How I built it
I’m good at iOS development, and bad at everything else. To get Publish as Website working, **these are the technologies I learned** or improved at -&gt;

- JavaScript
- Node JS
- HTML, CSS
- AWS
- DNS stuff

I spent about 2 weeks chewing over the Publish as Website project – reading articles, chatting with friends, drawing ideas, and going for walks and drinking Negronis. **Taking a birds’ eye view over the whole concept.**

**Then I broke it up into micro tasks that I was confident could be completed in 1-2 days each.** I’ve noticed that a subsystem in software can be perfect if it can be built in a single day. Basically, that’s the amount of time where the brain can hold on to absolutely every detail. After a day of intensity details get lost, so compartmentalizing is super useful, allowing for elegant micro-systems to coalesce into a hopefully-elegant super-system.

Then I started with the hardest parts, and got to work, session after session, until the whole thing was built.

——

Minimal is live in a few countries – go to []() and see if the smart banner shows up at the top. 

In other countries, Minimal is in private beta and you can download for free using Apple's TestFlight. Once launching publicly, I plan to charge a small monthly or annual fee after a super long free trial. However *beta testers will continue to have unlimited access to everything, totally free*. You can lock in your free access and begin contributing to Minimal’s roadmap by visiting []() and joining the beta.

Thanks, everyone! I built a new feature in Minimal | Notes called Publish as Website – this is why I’m so excited about it.",633

I went to Best Buy and saw a bunch of pretty cool looking notebooks (mostly the Google chrome book, surface line,) and wanted them but I can’t, because I’m in the Apple ecosystem. It’s like being in a candy store but you are only allowed gummy bears when I want chocolat and nerds and twisters. 

That’s when it hit me, I’m so bored of the Apple design, they haven’t changed it or made it fun/exciting with the almost identical design for what, the past  in tech years that’s a long time. 

Where are the fun personalized colors of the first iMacs, something different, new and fresh. 
And because I’m stuck in the ecosystem, it makes me feel in-prisoned (tech wise) and making me dislike Apple even though I don’t want to. 

And I didn’t even mention anything about iPads, watches, and phones. I m still on the iPhone 6plus because I don’t want a super fragile glass phone that breaks on the smallest of drops. Been rocking this one with no protection for 4years, dropped it 100 times and it’s still fine.

It’s absolutely flawless. It’s so fast, it’s smart, it’s got a gorgeous body with a great screen, and the battery is to die for. I could write a 7-paragraph review of it, but that’s not why I’m here. 

In addition to recently getting my new phone, I also just had surgery. Prior to my upgrade, I used my iPad a lot for my entertainment and browsing and reading, since it was so much bigger than the SE and it had a battery that lasted more than 5 hours. But now, with the Pro Max and my new inability to walk, I found the perfect balance. The Pro Max is big enough to enjoy my Netflix and reading, and I only have to plug it in at night. It’s the perfect upgrade for someone who has to get around on a scooter.

Very disappointing. I'm 100% sure it wasn't me - haven't had so much as a mark on my Macbook for years - but it's impossible to prove. Not to mention that repairing it would require replacing the whole case yet again, which seems kind of ridiculous for aesthetic, albeit annoying, damage.

Has anybody had the same experience? If so, did Apple refuse to repair on the grounds that it's impossible to prove they did it? Did they offer a gift card or some other kind of compensation? I could find very few relevant posts that aren't like a decade old.

(The lesson here: always check your device thoroughly in-store when you pick it up from a repair. Learn from my mistake!)

Edit: Just to clarify, the scratch is on the component that was replaced during the repair (the top case), so unfortunately taking photos of the device before sending it in would have been futile.

Edit 2: Thanks for the replies everybody. I tried calling but they seem to be absurdly busy, so I’ve booked the soonest possible appointment on Wednesday. Will update afterwards.

Edit 3: Good news! They offered to replace the top case again free of charge. The technician didn’t even ask to see the photos I took last week - they just took my word for it. Apple scratched my Macbook during repair",253

Apple Silicon:  

Apple’s education discount runs to the end of the month.  Does that indicate that no new models will arrive before October?  

Which model do you launch?  MacBook Pro at a higher MSRP but with a high launch performance expectation?  MacBook 12” at a lower MSRP but customers would be OK with iPad Pro-like performance. 

iPhone:  If you can’t launch all 4 at the same time do you launch the least desirable first?  How many people talked themselves into a launch iPhone 8 Plus but sold it a month later when iPhone X?  I can honestly say as an iPhone 11 Pro Max owner - if they  launch the 5.4” in September and the 6.7” Max Pro in November I’d probably end up owning both.

Apple Watch:  Since this looks to be an incremental upgrade do you launch first before the iPhone even if iPhone was ready because at this point people are itching to buy SOMETHING!

iPad: 

If you have a new pro ready why would you release it less than a year from the latest models?

If you have a new iPad Air would you launch it before October 1?  I can’t imagine they want to subsidize that model with free AirPods?

AppleTV:

Gaming is the next thing to conquer.  Are you ready to launch a new platform because Apple Arcade is pretty lame.  If you’re not ready for the next big thing then what would we need a new ATV for?

HomePod: 

How can you launch an HopePod that’s significantly more attractive than the current HomePod at $199 every other weekend at Best Buy.  Do you launch a rebranded Beats Pill with HomeKit/SIRI capability?

1,0.36,0,20,Appstradamus,"The future of Apple?

My prediction/personal wish-list. 

The key change here is going to be a paradigm shift in the way we think about our Apple devices and the importance of our Apple accounts. A truly fundamental change to how people perceive computers. 

With the introduction of the ARM chips Apple is going to double down on the “ecosystem” and feed it some steroids. 

Everyone has a phone, everyone. Lots of individuals or family’s now have multiple computers, desktops and laptops, iPads, sometimes one each sometimes a shared one. We all use them differently and for different reasons. 

Those reasons are more than ever based around the size of the screen.

One that fits in your pocket and goes everywhere and gets scrolled all day.

One that’s big enough to watch YouTube or Netflix on or look at photos on, and edit with logical touch input, but small enough to do so on the couch or in a cafe, with no power hampering portable woes of the past.

Or one that’s large enough to professionally appraise and edit 4K footage with close scrutiny or play REAL GAMES in higher detail (with the unification of architecture across iOS and Mac OS devices and software it would be silly for developers to not start accessing the wanting base of gamers that own Apple computers)

No matter the size, all of the screens will be similar in their high end specs. Expect 120hz, mini-LED, HDR, retina dpi.All “Apple calibrated” to some new marketing term level of consistency and colour accuracy. AppleView certified screen?

All devices, whether they have a folding keyboard attached, a seperate full size wireless keyboard, whether it’s attached to a stand or wether it’s just a screen in your pocket they will all share a super minimalist, thin-bezeled slate look.

All accessories can work wirelessly with any device. Seamlessly. I don’t need to look at another Bluetooth settings menu. Make it easier for me. Push Apple device button, all local Apple devices have a screen prompt (W1 chip?). Push the prompt on screen and then interact with device to connect. Disconnect at any time in the devices settings menu. 

They’ll all basically be a slate screen with an under screen Face ID system and shared camera (selfie camera only) hardware for picture consistency. IPhones and iPads will have underscreen Touch ID, iPads on both ends for easy pick up and go.

Laptops and desktops will have keyboard based Touch ID. iPad selfie camera will be  moved to a side position but Face ID will work vertically or horizontally, either way up or down, as long as you don’t happen to cover the camera whilst holding. And the angle and distance that Face ID works at is greatly improved. 

The Apple account will become the unifying factor. If you have an Apple device you must have an Apple account. They will unify the ecosystem even further. Hardware simply existing as different methods to access the same photos, files and signed in accounts.

First boot up of any device presents with a new user or existing user option. Further accessed within a “device accounts” sub menu in systems settings if you wish to add more people or find the currently registered accounts and their password protected details. While “add user” or the initial sign in process is activated the device is connected to an Apple encrypted server through some special implementation using a new t3 chip, common to all devices, which allows face recognition or Touch ID recognition instantly, on any device (using internet) to add your account. No clunky email log in trying to remember your password. Though Apple will implement something special recommendations around master passwords and secure access methods for account rescue. 

This is their bigger picture. This is the future. They will truly unify the ecosystem and user experience between products. You purchase your device to suit your size and use case requirements. But all your devices access the same files and shared apps where they exist. (Apps Can be toggled per device)

All of the newly unified-styling hardware will come with a limited amount of SSD storage 1TB lower spec and 5TB higher spec, which honestly is more than enough for most average users. Same hardware storage across phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, everything. But all of your devices are accessing your exact same account, files, apps, everything. 

You have unlimited online storage. FREE. It’s just part of having both an Apple account and an Apple device. Firstly, free storage has a fair and reasonable policy to stop abuse or commercial use. This storage isn’t accessed through a seperate website or app, it isn’t accessed anywhere specifically. It’s just your files. All of your files are automatically on all of your devices. Online. 

You can simply right click on a desktop or long press on a touch device (inside a new file browser app. Apple style on iOS and iPad OS). So you can selectively keep files local+online or even only local if you choose. This will all have special Apple encryption and total data anonimization. Their focus on security including hardware and software recently indicates this is a real concern and they’re taking it seriously. 

Devices can be toggled as shared devices. Family computers or iPads. Shared devices sleep to a user ID page with a simple UI. Probably memojis with names underneath. Press one of the user icons and with just a face scan or finger print it immediately opens to their custom desktop / app layout / file structure. All seamlessly. This is done through some AI optimised file storage of most accessed files that aren’t tagged as local but are actually being stored locally for frequent access, under a layer of local encryption. On device. With the T3 chip. In ALL new devices.

This being the always online nature of our computers and devices now anything that isn’t recognised as frequently used or stored locally can be accessed quicker than ever before through the internet anyway. 

Automatically shared health stats between devices. Heart rate, steps, sleep tracking, and a new focus on wellbeing around screen use. Apple want to creature the technology of the future, but they do more than many to make sure that future is as healthy as possible. 

Tighter integration between “phone book” and messages, and social accounts to give you a useful reference for any contact point to everyone you know. Extra details shared for people with Apple accounts. Messages to become closer to a Facebook messenger. 

Apple in a way will become your social media account. It’ll be used to log into other websites and apps and you never need a password. This is already happening. It will be your hardware account. And increasingly your content accounts as well, expect them to all be rolled into one Apple account with sub options and sub packages that aren’t all seperate products, just options. 

Imagine if this was all announced at a single press conference. Ushering in a new age for Apple and how we see computers and the always online world we live in. The future of Apple?",1178

Each recipe has an introduction to what the dish or component is, along with step by step instructions on how to prepare, cook, and enjoy the meal. Additionally, they are all presented using beautiful illustrations and interactive animations. There are also notes and tips along the way to help make the cooking process fun and easy.

That does not take into account the 22% VAT that we have to pay in Italy, though, so I recalculated the American price, multiplying by 1.22. That gives a result of €2473, which is still a €330 difference that I cannot explain.

YES!! YES!! This is all speculation and is my personal opinion. VERY OBVIOUSLY I don't know if this will ever come to fruition. However, if it does, then the ARM era for Apple will be the biggest move they will make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# So let's start with something simple.

""What's a Computer?"". For ordinary people, a computer is an input and output device. Simple right? Well for Apple, it's an iPad. 

Now we know that Apple has been trying to make the iPad a Computer (more of a laptop) replacement for years, and good on them. I mean it's a neat idea. But it didn't go so well so far now has it..

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's where my theory comes in. I believe Apple will ""merge"" iPad and Macbook.

Yes, it sounds crazy but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

# The facts we know:

1. The new MacBooks will run on an Apple chip, which will obviously run the next iPhones and iPads.
2. Due to fact 1, MacOS is now supporting ARM architecture.
3. BigSur has many features that hint at a touchscreen, despite the MacBook not having one.
4. The reason iPad isn't a good PC replacement is because of iPadOS.
5. Apple wants MacOS to resemble IOS as much as possible, maybe even make them the same

# 

# Now, why tho?

Why would Apple, a company wildly known for their amazing hardware and software design, make an OS which is more useable with a touchscreen than with a touchpad/mouse?

Well, I think they mislead us.

I mean, a MacBook which is so similar to an iPad power-wise and portability-wise? Why would you make these two devices but give them a completely different software experience? It does seem dumb, doesn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

# The more technical:

Now, Hackintosh has been a thing for forever. It's a cool project to do if you have the time. 

But a thing about operating systems, an OS will run on ANY CPU you put it on as long as:

1. The CPU is powerful enough
2. The CPU architecture is the one that the OS is designed to run on

Now with that in mind, what exactly is stopping people from installing the ARM macOS on an iPad? Well, nothing really, I mean, both are ARM architectures. Plus, ARM macOS will be able to run IOS and iPadOS natively. So the support is there.

&amp;#x200B;

# The big picture:

Now I think Apple knows people will do that, and I believe Apple will make the MacBook and iPad line like so:

MacBook running macOS and iPad running the same macOS.

It's really a genius move if you think about it, taking your entire, DESKTOP Adobe library? On the go? Who the fck doesn't want that? And the next iPad will come with the same (ish) CPU that the ARM MacBook will have. So it all adds up.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the MacBook and iPad line will be like this:

Want a good and affordable device? Here's an 800$ MacBook for you.

Want a better device that has a touch screen, pen AND FaceID? Here, a more expensive iPad.

And both will perform the same tasks, just depends on what you need.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus it makes more sense when you think that macOS BigSur is designed with touch in mind, so put it on an iPad, it works perfectly. But put it on a MacBook, still works perfectly!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it is all theories, but if it's true, then man are we about to go into a whole new Apple era.

An era where they may become dominant amongst all.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what do you all think? Why I believe ARM will be a bigger revolution than we thought",588

User Created Folders max out at displaying 9 apps and swiping right to left to see additional pages of apps, while App Library Folders displays 28 apps and allows the user to scroll downward to see more apps.  This experience is smoother than swiping through pages of apps and shows more information.

Is there any reason why Apple is withholding feature parity between these two seemingly similar applications of the same process? iOS folders and iOS App Library functional disparity",137

1,0.52,1,0,rshakiba,"[NikooPlayer]() is not only a good offline music player, but it could be a handy practice tool for musicians also. Here are some examples on how you can use it for your practices:

* **Practice Section by Section:** How you eat an Elephant? One bite at a time.This is so true about practicing a complicated piece of music. Our *Jump Board* is a perfect tool for this. You can easily navigate through your music, select the section you want to practice, loop it, and then go to next section.
* **Start Slow:** Starting to practice with slower speeds is also one of key lessons that every musicians know. But most of the time, your options are limited to 1x, .75x, .5x. But usually we need more precise control on this and most of music players simply don't have this capability. NikooPlayer could give you precise control on playback speed from -8x to +8x with .01x precision! So you can start with what speed that you are comfortable with, and then progress gradually to higher speeds.
* **Listen to your practice:** listening to your own practice recordings is a good idea to see how good you are doing, but usually it is not so effective as our brain used to it and it is hard for us to see our own mistakes. One way to overcome this problem, is to listen to your practice with different pitch and speed, this will pivot your brain as if you are listening to someone else practice and suddenly you can see your mistakes. Our *pitch-speed control tab* is a perfect tool for this and you can adjust these two aspects at the same time to find the best combination. This is the same technique drawing artists are using to see their pitfalls, they usually flip their drawings left and right to see it from different angle.
* **Sing Along:** singing along could be challenging when you are not alone and we all know how we sound if we try to sing while we are wearing an headphone. We have designed a sing along feature that could allow you to sing along with your song while you are wearing an headphone and still sound good.

Thank you so much for your time for reading this self promo content. *NikooPlayer* is available only for iOS devices now and you can try its free version that includes all of its features with some limitations on number of songs. NikooPlayer would improve your music practice",412

1,0.44,0,35,OrganicPancakeSauce,"I absolutely love apple. Their technology has changed the game for me. I’ve been an Apple rider since the iPhone 4 was released to Verizon. 

My MacBook, iPhone, Mac mini, and iPad all connect and make it so easy to move from device to device. The iPhone 11 Pro is a beautiful creation and with the new iOS 14 beta, I’ve fallen back in love with their design. 

The Big Sur beta fell on its face IMO, because it ruined VS Code for me, something I need every day so I couldn’t keep it loaded. However, the UI is absolutely beautiful. There are subtle changes that make it so gorgeous, to me, that I cannot wait for the public release. 

Purple is my favorite color and rumor shows a dark blue / purplish iPhone coming out. Color me excited, son!

Some may call me an apple simp, some may call me a cult follower, and others may call me downright silly. But, Apple, take my money. Your privacy is top-notch and one of the selling points for me. 

Apple Music? Catch me spending my $$$ on your subscription. iCloud? Catch me spending $$ on 500gb of storage (while complaining about the cost).

iPhone upgrade program? Catch me diving into a new lease every major release (no S devices here). 

What is everyone most excited for with this event coming? For me, it’s the new phones &amp; the public releases of Big Sur and iOS 14.

Obviously I understand the wait but I’m just excited to have an upgraded device so any hope is lovely haha. Plus with my Air only working 50% of the time I am eager to have something I can rely on.

So I have a 2017 Macbook Pro and the j key started missing 6-7 months ago, sometimes it was a miss sometimes the character would press twice but i dealt with it as i am a CS student and could not affort to let my laptop go in for repair, sometimes it would work fine.

However a month ago i started getting the service battery warning which would go away after i reset my SMC but yesterday i found the time to take my macbook in and they said it was eligible for a free keyboard/topcase replacement under Apple’s program

Today i got a call back from them saying that they have found indications of liquid damage and the keyboard and logic board would need to be replaced first at a crazy fee or else my Macbook is not eligible for the free keyboard replacement

I do not recall spilling anything on my Macbook and it has no other signs of damage other than the j key, everything else has been working fine and i dont know why the logic board needs to be replaced

Would appreciate if anyone has had any experience with this and could helpm me out

1,0.71,121,115,ateh123,"I don’t think I’ve ever encountered anything like this as an Apple customer ever. It’s just absolutely ridiculous. This whole story started when my MacBook Pro’s backlight was starting to turn off when at certain angles, but then randomly just stopped working together. Luckily (or maybe unluckily in my situation), as a technician myself, I knew about Apple’s MacBook Pro Backlight Replacement program. My MacBook Pro is the 2.9GHz model from the 2016 release year, so it was under the eligible models listed, and the backlight being completely gone was an eligible symptom of the repair program. 

May 18 - So, I chatted online and got my first mailin setup for this MacBook. The box came a few days later, I sent it in to the repair center, and it was delivered to them. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. The repair center marks it as “Repair Completed” the same day it is delivered, and sends it back to me. I thought “Hey, they’re really quick at repairing displays!”. Yeah, no. I received it back saying I “didn’t authorize the repair” which was obviously complete bogus since I didn’t receive any communication. After this, I chatted again, but was told that they wouldn’t be able to setup anything for me online, I was forced to go to an Apple Store or AASP. 

May 18 to June 20 - During this time I reserved about 3 or 4 appointments, but every time, it would get cancelled.

June 20 - I was finally able to get an appointment for this day. I went into the store, and was able to talk to a friendly technician. They immediately helped me out, and said that they would send it back to the repair center for service since the store itself doesn’t really fix repair program devices. 

June 23 - Apple repair center received the MacBook, and put it on “Diagnosis in progress”.

June 23 to July 3 - Radio silence from the Apple repair center or the store, and the repair is still on “Diagnosis in Progress” stage.

July 3 - I decide to call in to the store myself. An admin of the store lets me know that the repair center is refusing to repair the MacBook. They tell me that they have escalated the case and will get back to me on a decision as soon as possible.

July 3 to July 9 - Once again, radio silence, still on “Diagnosis in Progress” stage.

July 9 - I get an email saying my “Repair Request is Complete” and that my MacBook is coming back to me. I was skeptical, so I reached out to the same store admin. He let me know that the MacBook was actually denied AGAIN, and that the person who received their escalation at the repair center just said “send the escalation to someone else” and didn’t bother to do anything. The admin tells me that I should wait to receive the Macbook back, set up an appointment, and bring it in to be looked at for the third time. I am just fed up with this, so I go ahead and call Apple Support over the phone at about 7:30PM CST. It takes me over an hour to get connected with a very nice lady who tells me that she will have to get a Senior Advisor involved (takes about another 40-50 min). At first she gets me connected with a Senior Advisor, but she was an iOS Senior Advisor. So I wait another 5 minutes to get connected with a Mac Senior Advisor. The situation is explained to him and he lets me know that he will contact the store when they open the next day, because they “have to set up the repair a certain way” in order to get it serviced.

July 10 - The Macbook is delivered to me in the morning. I get a call from the Senior Advisor about 20 minutes after the store has opened (approx 11:20AM CST), and he lets me know that he has informed the store of the situation, and that I can just bring the MacBook into the store whenever is convenient for me, but he recommends going at a time where the store isn’t as busy so I can get the service I need. I obviously want to get this fixed as soon as possible but I was a bit busy. I did make it to the Apple Store about 12 minutes before they closed, and got a manager involved. They told me that they will take the MacBook for now, and that I will get a call from one of the 2 admins on my case, since they weren’t there when the store was getting ready to close.

July 11 - I get a phone call from the Apple Store at 1:46 PM CST, and get connected to the same admin who was helping me before. He attempts to get me off the call by quickly saying that my “MacBook is not covered by this repair program”. I kindly let him know that it actually is — my model is the eligible model and the no backlight is an eligible symptom of the repair program too. He tells that they’re going to open up the MacBook to make sure. He puts me on hold for about 13 minutes, and then comes back to say that “Sorry, your MacBook IS eligible for the repair program” but that they won’t be able to repair it — only if I pay $200+tax. I tell him that this is ridiculous if you just ADMITTED my MacBook is covered, but won’t repair it for free. He tells me that unfortunately he doesn’t have ANY options, not even a CS code or replacement. At this point, I’m literally at a loss for words. Seriously? After that, I called Apple Support for another long (1hr) call, which obviously got me nowhere. The Senior Advisor told me that because the repair center declined it, that they can’t actually put it under the repair program anymore. Why would Apple trust a company like CSAT Solutions (the repair depot company) to actually look at a device when it’s described as a “sweatshop” by its employees?! Apple doesn’t trust its employees I guess, because I’ve had multiple technicians/managers confirm to me that it’s eligible for the program.

I try to be an understanding customer, with patience and kindness, but in this case, I am just enraged at this point. No one can help me except just charge me more! I have been without a working MacBook for almost 2 months now, and I’ve wasted over 10+ hours on this case, with no resolution. Apple’s service is absolutely appalling. Never going to buy a MacBook from Apple again, and I suggest you don’t either. They DONT actually honor their repair programs! I’m pretty sure they are legally obligated to repair something under a repair program, but I’m no legal expert — still, it’s appalling and degrading as a customer.

Edit: I tried getting transferred to Customer Relations, as some had suggested on various subreddits, but was told by another Senior Advisor that they couldn’t transfer me to Customer Relations since Customer Relations told the Senior Advisor that he can do more than them, apparently. Next step is Executive Relations. I’ve scheduled via my email for an email to send to them a little after the corporate office opens on Monday. Wish me luck!

Edit 2: My email was sent to Tim Cook, Sabih Khan, and John Williams around 10AM CST, July 13. I hope to get a response from someone soon!

Edit 3: Got a phone call from someone at Executive Relations at 6PM CST, July 13! He told me I’m probably not going to get a replacement but that he’ll definitely look into the issue.

LAST Edit: Executive Relations Representative reached out to me, and let me know that he “can’t tell me why” I don’t qualify for the Repair Program, but it’s “due to multiple reasons”. Not really sure what he means by that, but I guess I’m done contacting them. Just gonna go get it repaired at a third party probably, because Apple’s quote isn’t really worth it, or just sell it for parts on eBay or something. At this point, if corporate can’t help me, then I’m sure no one can. Apple REFUSES to Fix MacBook Pro Under Repair Program!",1396

1,0.64,49,95,MrC4meron,"Say what you want about it but I think it's a fact that some people who get the new iPhones but don't already own a charger and need a new one will almost definitely look to cheap alternatives, and I mean the ***super cheap alternatives.***

We could expect a major boom in these cheap chargers online in such sites as Wish, Amazon and eBay; and even some that will replicate Apple's versions and sell them as ""genuine"". 

Now not only could these lead to a worse consumer experience but a **more dangerous** one too as a lot of these cheap chargers will not be properly tested and certified for safety (A lot of manufactures skip this as it's expensive to get this certification and to bring the prices down).  This could lead to damage to iPhones and possibly **even cause house fires.**

Unless Apple and others could sufficiently crack down on these dodgy chargers or even just bring the prices down on the existing chargers then we could be faced with a serious problem in the future.  Just another thing to think about.

TLDR: iPhones coming without chargers could lead to more people buying cheap chargers which could be dangerous. A major downside (and dangerous) to the ""No charger"" rumour",209
1,0.93,1984,315,lovemyjobatApple,"I created a throwaway to post this because although my anxiety has been high for months, I generally enjoy and need my job. 

I’ve worked for Apple Support for a number of years. I’ve been on the other side of the phone and chat when you’ve contacted Apple for assistance with your device. Most people I talk too are sincerely pleasant and we’re able to work together to identify and solve their issues. We may not always reach that resolution quickly, but we do generally either resolve or put the necessary steps in order to resolve the issue. 

COVID has been tough for everyone, and although Apple retail stores have closed, Apple support has been open without fail to provide assistance for that computer you haven’t used since 2007 that you now need to download Zoom on to be able to work from home, among other things. Volumes have been high and I haven’t missed work, even though my family and home life have been impacted just like everyone else’s. I’ve been the one to apologize for the long wait times as you hold for us, the one to work to find a resolution since we can’t get you in a store right now, the one that takes the abuse because you’re angry that your watch is taking to long to update and just need someone to yell at. And at the end of each day, I log out of work and try not to let the stress of the day bleed into my home life.   My husband is a bar tender and has been out of work since the beginning of COVID and my son has had to complete middle school from home in isolation, they don’t need the added stress of hearing about my day. 

Which brings me to the reason for this post. You see, I’m not stressed by the workload. I’m not stressed because of the angry, sad, frustrated, you name it, people that I work with every day. I’m not stressed about the long wait times, the ever changing procedures, the fact that stores are closed. No. I’m stressed about your surveys. 

If you’ve contacted us before, you’re probably familiar with that quick little survey you get asking you to rate your service. You probably don’t spend a lot of time on it and don’t even think it really matters. You’re wrong. That survey is tied to every single person you’ve talked to about your situation and directly impacts their job. I live in constant fear of being fired because although you left a comment that the service was great, you’re ultimately unsatisfied because I couldn’t give you something for free ~ because I don’t have that ability.  I may have only spoken to you to transfer you the right department, but that survey you left about being angry that YOU couldn’t change your password to your own Apple ID because you can’t verify your identity, that survey could be enough to get me talked to, written up or fired. 

Apple takes customer feedback very, very seriously. And so do I. And I don’t mind feedback when I’m genuinely in the wrong and get called out, I consider that a learning opportunity. But so many of you leave scathing feedback because you’re unhappy about something absolutely beyond my control. Many times, it’s about your Apple account, which we have no access to at all. Do you not understand that due to our high levels of privacy and security, we have absolutely NO access to reset your passwords or change any of your account information? Maybe you don’t understand that there is a real person behind that call or chat who genuinely wants to help you in most cases. I get it that not all Apple Support advisors are perfect and that you may have had a bad experience once, but I assure you that isn’t the norm or the majority. My coworkers and I work really, really hard to fix your issues and to make sure you’re happy with the outcome. 

I run the risk of being written up for getting just 1 bad survey a month, and since COVID started, I’ve gotten more than that believe me.  But I’m not a bitter employee whining about you guys, I’m really not. Not 1 of these surveys have been because I did something wrong or gave bad information in the last 3 months. Not one. Instead, I’ve gotten them because the hold time was high, or because you want me to replace an out of warranty iPad 2 with a brand new iPad Pro for free, or you want me to change your password for an Apple ID for you because you can’t verify your own security questions or access your own email. 

I love my job. I generally love my customers. I’m only taking the time to write this because I just want people to remember to be kind and understand that I will bend over backwards to help you when you reach out to Apple support.  Things have been tough all around, and I will absolutely do my best to help you when and if I can. For the most part, I work with pretty amazing people every day. And for those of you that exhibit patience even when you’re frustrated, I appreciate you and will work hard to make sure you’re happy at the end of our conversation. 

I hope that’s what you remember when you get that little survey. 

TL,DR:  Apple surveys matter to everyone

Edit/Update:
I thought about this post for a long time before I added it. I analyzed my words to ensure I was conveying things appropriately. I realize after reading some of your comments and with the benefit of hindsight that my intent may not have exactly matched my words. So I’d like to reiterate that I love my job, and I love the customers I work with. I genuinely didn’t mean to come across as a complainer or someone who is whining about the work I do. I love Apple and the whole Apple philosophy. I guess the take away that I’d intended was that your feedback not only matters, but also directly impacts the people that you work with, in both positive and negative ways. I have also provided feedback through internal channels for those who have inquired, and I appreciate those of you that have taken the time to respond.

[ThoughtJots]() (for a brief visual at how my app works)

Journaling can be... weird. Digital journaling? Definitely weird.

It's apparent that during COVID I've spent a lot of time with thoughts swirling around in my head. Reduced social interaction, toxic online melting pots, and spurts of anxiety have really taken its toll on me. I even stopped journaling because - hey, every day looks the same now, right?

But maybe journaling doesn't have to take itself so seriously. Everyday's high, low, and everything in between is worth mentioning. I made a light-hearted, fresh journaling experience that removes the pressure of looking perfect on paper.

ThoughtJots is a prompt based digital journal that helps users write more naturally. It presents the user with randomized statements where the user is expected to ""fill in the \_\_\_\_\_ "" regarding their day. The user can skip prompts or expound, it's all up to the user, whether they find prompts relevant or not.

The point is that the user can express their thoughts by jotting them down in a self-conversing manner without racking their brains. Afterwards or even during, the user can pull up a draft overview of their current writing session to make refinements.

We're going to look back on 2020 and remember what the heck it was all about, really.

\---

\*\*\*If you never clicked with writing journals... I'd love to know if you can jive with this. Give it a shot and let me know!

Currently am in need of testers to help with feedback! Would love to hear your ThoughtJots! :)

This include ready to use tool bars and a powerful pitch-speed control pad that actually enables you to change both (playback) speed and pitch at the same time so you can land on right place much easier.

Then you can add a little bit reverb and may be a 3D effect to make the audio more pleasant.

NikooPlayer can automatically list all of your locally stored music, podcasts (downloaded one), audio books, playlists, and you can also copy any other audio file from any other source to it or use airdrop feature on you iOS device.

It does the first thing two things well, but I can't determine how it does the last thing (ie. handoff).  Im not sure if its up to individual apps to support it or if its a system feature, Im using airplay wrong, or I had a misunderstanding about airplay 2.  One of the biggest gripes about airplay was that when airplaying something, browsing to a site with video, and then having that video audio come out airplay, interrupting your original airplay stream.  That doesn't seem to be fixed, unless the video is a youtube video.

3 Examples - 

I can start a song in Apple Music, airplay it to my Sonos One (which is Airplay 2 compatible)... If I then open Podcasts and play a podcast it takes over the ""now playing"" card in Control Center and goes to my Move, stopping my music stream.   I couldn't find a way to have a podcast play locally and apple music continue to play on an airplay target since there is only the one now playing card in control center.

Netflix does the same thing.  If I start a netflix video it takes over now playing and comes out the move.

Youtube does not, however I can't control youtube volume independently from the airplay 2 speaker... so if I turn up the video volume on my phone (hardware buttons or GUI), it also turns up the airplay 2 volume, but at least the audio streams are different between airplay 2 target and locally.

The problem seems less an Airplay issue, more that there is only one audio source at a time, yet somehow phone calls and youtube manages to get around it. Airplay 2 Handoff Functionality?",328
1,0.8,128,123,vorheehees,"I know we’ve seen plenty threads on this, and some of this be rehash, but I don’t think many people (developers / consumers / Epic) have thought this all through:

WHAT CONSUMERS GAIN:

* Emulators and many some pretty awesome software that apple won’t allow (see: XCloud).
* Options. You have the option to find lower rates and have apps that take more liberties with your phone (for better or for worse). Cheaper rates definitely sounds nice, and I’m sure some people will even find ways to take advantage of the new $free.99 pricing structure. Personally, I might be one of those people in the latter category because....

WHAT CONSUMERS LOSE:

* Less guarantees on privacy. If developers don’t have to put up with this headache, they won’t.
* Less applications using Apple sanctioned API’s and going to other stores to avoid App Store review. This may mean more variety, but I think it’ll more likely lead to inconsistencies, developers not supporting Apple API’s as much as they do now, overall decline in app quality and polish, less system optimizations, etc.
* More companies potentially having access to your credit cards / payment information. You’re losing a single channel for many channels.
* Alternative stores hoarding exclusives to force you into their store. PC gamers know all too well that if Epic Games gets a store on iOS they’ll be buying exclusives left and right. Expect Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, social media, etc. to whore themselves out to Epic Games because they don’t even want to be under Apple’s privacy thumb in the first place.
* No sign-in with Apple ID. Many more apps requesting payment details to circumvent the app store and many more apps requesting you make accounts with them w/o a secure and private single sign-on.
* Less protections against malware and less recourse on being made whole should something screw with your system (as it stands, Apple gives out a refund if you just request it).
* A less cohesive ecosystem. You can’t have one app purchase run across all your devices unless the other store you’re buying from is on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac.

WHAT DEVELOPERS GAIN

* More freedom. They can do whatever the fuck they want within reason (for better or for worse). Don’t like their privacy stances? Fuck you, they’ll make their APK available solely from their website with all of the offending code that Apple wouldn’t permit. But on the bright side, we will get more capable software that can interact and make positive system changes as well. Think different themes for your phone and non-native music apps being default. Say hello to tweaks.
* Potentially more revenue (but I don’t think this will happen unless you’re a rather large dev with custom DRM).
* All those apps that Apple denies for arbitrary reasons? They’re now all permissible (again, for better or for worse).

WHAT DEVS LOSE:

* Strong piracy protections. This one will hurt their bottom lines in ways I don’t think they’re expecting. And personally, as a dev, I wouldn’t blame a consumer if they tried to pirate my work if that option became much more viable. I fully expect a non-walled garden experience to be coupled with less privacy protections and a general decline in app quality. Devs will want to use platform agnostic API’s much more, and that will result in less optimized apps. People will want to shotgun any and everything between Android and iOS. And if this prediction is correct, I couldn’t blame a consumer for wanting the apps to be free. Hell, you want my data and you want to charge me for a crappier experience where I have to go and download your custom launcher for this one app? You better believe I’m searching for a free alternative. There’s a reason app developers make more money on iOS... Apple customers are forced and conditioned to go through official channels as unofficial ones are much more difficult. Open those barriers a bit, and I think you’ll see people aren’t so happy to pay a similar amount.
* Apple may resort to pettiness and just charge for their tools. I personally doubt this will happen because it might affect their hardware sales should there be less devs, but I’m sure that they’ll find a way to restructure their business to retain some form of a cut (or at least try to).
* Smaller-to-medium sized developers will have to put up with much more overhead should they leave the app store. Again, that’s their choice, but I don’t think they realize the value provided here by Apple. Hosting, payment processsing, online dispute resolution, translation services, global tax services, world-class API’s and tools, free advertising, customer install base, handling of credit card processing fees, etc. Perhaps this isn’t worth 30% any more, and I agree that the rate should be scrutinized, but it’s definitely worth at least 20%. These are pretty low rates (even 30%) when you look at the cost structure of pretty much any other industry. The fee is also in-line with their competitors and has remained static since the store’s inception. This isn’t even considering that Apple may put much less resources into this store should all the bigger players leave. If they’re not getting a cut of Prime Video subscriptions, why would they invest so much money into app review, curation, etc. for small indie devs. I think the rate on larger devs (and the app store in general) ultimately levels the playing field for smaller people.
* Free app store advertising. Your app won’t be featured on those large, fancy articles in the Today View that have reportedly made app developer’s careers. There are other methods of advertising, of course, but be prepared to see smaller and medium sized devs get further lost in the race unless someone fills this gap for cheap or free.

WHAT EPIC GAINS:

* More opportunities to sell make believe IAP to children with less overhead and less scrutiny.
* More weight behind their store, which they’d try to pivot into being everywhere. They may see this as a way to combat Steam more effectively by pitching their services as being home and mobile instead of just stuck on PC.

WHAT EPIC GAMES LOSES:

* Probably a lot of IAP. They’ve already been shown to struggle on Android trying to sell Fortnite direct, but maybe the stars will align and their fortunes will change?

* Business model scrutiny. If we can arbitrarily define monopolies as anything we want, I’m sure someone will want to define Epic’s control over the Fortnite marketplace as monopolistic in order to take advantage and sell wares. A discussion on what we lose and gain should Epic Games be permitted to have their own store...",1109

Step 1: Openly invite Google Stadia, Playstation Now, GeForce Now, and SteamLink services onto the Xbox platform.

Step 2: Launch xCloud on the web but require the Edge browser (incl the iOS version of Edge, for which an update will be submitted to Apple including xCloud + controller support) for it to work.

Long version:

Step 1: 

Both Apple and Microsoft have both Open and Closed software platforms - for Apple, the Mac is open (can sideload any software via official means), and iOS is closed. For Microsoft, Windows is open, the Xbox is closed. The only argument Apple can make right now is that they are -as fair- as Microsoft is on their own closed platform. Saying “But iCloud apps are on the Windows marketplace!” is Apples to Oranges. 

Microsoft could immediately invalidate this argument by openly inviting Google Stadia, Playstation Now, GeForce Now, and SteamLink (and any others I’m missing) onto the Xbox, and if they really wanted to be boss about it, they could publicly offer terms to those companies that are smaller cuts (or no cut!) than Apple’s infamous 30%.

The best part is, those companies don’t even need to actually follow through and make the apps (though some certainly would) in order for Microsoft to score this leverage. Just by openly inviting it, Apple (and those defending them) can no longer say “but they’re treating iOS no differently than MS is treating Xbox”.  Boom.

Step 2:

Apple explicitly said in their statements ‘If you want to go around the App Store, use the web’ so take them up on the offer. xCloud probably isn’t possible on Safari in iOS (not sure if iOS Game Controller inputs pass thru to Safari, and there is probably some local code being executed for xCloud streaming to work, even if its mostly just a video stream).  But Microsoft already makes a browser on iOS - Edge. They could submit to Apple an update to Edge that adds controller support and whatever else code xCloud needs, and then tell people “Go to  in the Edge browser to sign in and stream xCloud over the web!”.

Apple could - and probably would, knowing them - reject the app update. But Microsoft doesn’t have to be quiet about it. And the fact that Apple said “do it over the web” and now Microsoft are trying to do just that and Apple are *STILL* blocking them makes Apple’s position impossibly weak.

Do both together? And do an aggressive ad campaign in partnership with Samsung not only selling xCloud on Galaxy S20 but also - right in the ad - saying “You can’t do this on your iPhone, Apple won’t let you”. If I were Microsoft this is what I would do to force Apple’s hand and get Game Pass streaming on iOS",464

Hey r/Apple!

I'm decently active in this community, but for those of you who I haven't said hi to, I'm an iOS app developer, I used to work at Apple and now for the last several years I've built [Apollo for Reddit](), an awesome Reddit app for iOS that I built with the goal of ""what would it look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app?"". 

### What's going on today?

Today it's my 27th birthday, and I want to raise a bunch of money for the SPCA Animal Shelter and a bunch of animals that are going through some rough times. Heck, I want to go a step further and break the all-time single day donation record. **So for today, 100% of Apollo's proceeds are going to the SPCA.**

If you buy literally anything in the app like Apollo Pro, I'll donate 100% of the proceeds to the SPCA, so it's a great day if you even have a passing interest in Apollo. If you already have unlocked things in Apollo, boy do I have a treat for you! A lot of people have been asking for an ""animals/pets"" style homescreen icon option for Apollo, and today I released a ""stealth update"" that has an all new SPCA themed icon commissioned by the absolutely incredible [David Lanham](). It's so gorgeous, [I love how it turned out](). Not only today, but literally for every day forever, 100% of the proceeds for this will go to the SPCA. You get the icon, some wallpapers, and even an exclusive Apollo Community Pets Photo Album included. There's even another Easter egg if you unlock it. 

If you want to go the direct route instead (or in addition) that would be amazing too! I created a direct fundraiser page:  This is doubly awesome if you have an employer who donation-matches to charities. Seriously, I know a lot of people are like ""hurr durr every dollar counts"" but no bullshit, it **really** does here. Think of the size of this community, 1.6 million people. If even a small percentage of them gave a single dollar we could make a massive difference. 

### What's an ""Apollo""? It's a different Reddit app?

If you're happy with the official app and have no idea what Apollo is, that's totally cool. I wasn't really perfectly happy with any of the iOS Reddit app offerings out there (especially with Alien Blue's passing). The official app in particular (while built by some insanely smart people whom I have a ton of respect for) I think tries to toe the line between a single experience across their Android and an iOS apps more than I like, so I really wanted to create an iOS-first Reddit experience that felt at home on iOS, built for speed, power features, and insanely great media consumption. It's free to download and use!

It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer, Smart Portrait Lock, and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [John Gruber of Daring Fireball]() as well as [The Sweet Setup](), with over 2 million downloads and over 100K 5-star reviews.

### Why right now?

These warm months are dubbed ""[kitten season]()"" by shelters, because it's the time of the year that all the cats like to give birth. So the shelters get a sudden massive influx of a ton of orphaned and surrendered (and sometime left to die) kittens and it massively drains their resouces like food. This is amplified by the COVID pandemic where a lot less people have been able to gets their pets neutered, and adoptions have lessened due to people staying inside. So it's a really, really hard time of the year and they (and the animals they're helping) are really in need of the help.

They're also special for me because it's where I rescued my two cats. Pet tax photo album: 

So yeah, if you enjoy my work at all, or like animals at all, or want me to have a good birthday, or just want some happiness in this otherwise crappy year, it would really mean the world to me if you could check out any of the above links and help out the shelter. The donation record for a single day [is $27,355 that we set last year](), but I really really want to beat it this year! I think with the combination of the new icon, Apollo having more users than ever, and the direct donation option, we can do it.

I'll of course keep you all posted once I find out how much Apollo raised by tomorrow! In the meantime I'd love to hang around and talk if you have any questions or insights or just want to share pet pics haha.

\- Christian

EDIT: Only a few hours left! When this post turns 24 hours old the donations will be totaled! If you're considering Apollo now is the perfect time! 9:30 AM PT is the time mark! Thank you so much everyone!

EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly! I'm a former Apple engineer and I build the Apollo Reddit client! Today for my birthday I'm donating 100% of Apollo's proceeds to my SPCA Animal Shelter who really need the help. If you've ever had a passing interest in Apollo (or even already have it, secrets inside) there's no better day! 🐶🐱",952
